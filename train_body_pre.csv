murder of american journalist jam foley a well a the broader threat the group could pose to u s interest should change his cautious calculus pressure be come from his own military leader to go after the islamic state inside syria but he must weigh that against his aversion to the risk that could come with plunge the unite state into a country tear apart by an intractable internal conflict white house official have suggest that airstrikes in syria be an option though the official say specific military proposal have not yet be present to the president we re actively consider what s go to be

168,get ready for the tech press to flip out when apple announce the retail price for the gold apple watch edition model apple critic have always roast the company for sell product that be more expensive than they should be and they frequently use this a a wedge topic to criticize buyer but the karat gold apple watch edition will set a whole new bar with a sale price of the funny thing in this case be that apple be perfectly right to be charge that much do you disagree check out my counterpoint the case against the gold apple watch edition gold be expensive let s start with a little backgrounder in gold everyone have a vague sense that gold be expensive even rabid internet troll have see the banner ad and hear about that in the news but most people don t understand just how expensive even a little bite of gold be so this be a good place to begin the discussion update my calculation be wrong also this be a bite back of the envelope now that it have some readership i realize i should go back and fix the calculation in the article to be more realistic here be the basic fact gold currently sell for between and per troy ounce and have be over per troy ounce for the last five year karat gold contain pure gold and that term be regulate by law one ounce of k gold occupy about cubic centimeter of volume since a typical karat gold alloy weigh about gram per cc karat gold currently sell for per gram per troy ounce or per cc cc of k gold be about enough to construct a watch buckle and cc get you a deployant clasp it take a few more to build a watch case anywhere from to cc depend on the size and thickness of the case so the buckle be worth and the watch case to just a raw gold this be why gold watch generally sell for a lot more than gold watch be expensive let s apply this to a watch case imagine you want to create a rectangular case mm high by mm wide by mm deep if it be solid this would equal cc of volume but it s a watch case so you have to leave room for the movement dial case back etc so let s just leave mm of thickness all around make a hollow rectangle this equal cc x x x x therefore the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost a of this write a simple x x mm rectangle of mm thick karat gold would cost over a simple x x mm rectangle of mm thick karat gold would cost more than now let s consider the same shape but just mm thick that s cc of gold worth pick your thickness and you re still look at thousand of dollar worth of gold how do this translate in the real world let s look at the retail price of some watch that be available in both stainless steel and karat gold this cartier tank mc be more in k gold this cartier tank mc be more in k gold the cartier tank mc measure mm by mm by mm thick extra list for k gold cartier tank mc in stainless steel list street cartier tank mc in k pink gold list street the jaeger lecoultre reverso squadra hometime measure mm by mm by mm thick extra list for k gold jaeger lecoultre reverso squadra hometime in stainless steel list street jaeger lecoultre reverso squadra hometime in k pink gold list street this list could go on and on but the gist be simple karat gold case cost a lot more than stainless steel in fact it s pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under in any size and from any manufacturer even tiny quartz lady watch like the tiny chopard happy sport mini sell for most of the bargain commenters have point to be either karat or le very slim and small or long out of production and with outdated price then there s the bracelet swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you be look at an extra add a gold bracelet to that jaeger lecoultre bump the price to certainly there be quite a bite of profit in luxury watch but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case and the gold market be liquid like stock and other commodity there be plenty of buyer and seller of gold and plenty of reserve so no company no matter how strong can expect favorable price from their supplier another reason company charge so much for gold watch and jewelry be a a hedge against volatility they can t price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long so they generally price somewhat higher than they would even take into consideration all the rest of the material labor distribution and profit in a watch the apple watch edition will cost there s a reason i pick those two watch for my comparison both be similar in size and shape to the mm apple watch the cartier be a little smaller and the jaeger lecoultre be a little larger but both represent a traditional watchmaker s gold case square ish offer in the space and both cost more than with much of that price go to the gold case and match buckle and jony ive recently say that the historic cartier tank be one of his inspiration for the apple watch design apple would be crazy to sell the apple watch edition for though that s not go to happen so they re likely to find way to reduce the cost dramatically first a we can see the apple watch case be highly round in all three dimension although questionable from an esthetic standpoint this reduce the amount of material require by quite a lot second apple watch have a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display sensor and such third the interior frame be likely make of steel or aluminum not gold to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel version could it be gold plat no numerous report state that it be a solid gold case although apple have not apparently use the word solid in their press release they do claim it be craft from karat gold and nowhere do it say it be plat or gold fill the industry term there be law cover description of metal content for jewelry and apple cannot break these any more than tiffany could apple say that the apple watch will start at for that aluminum sport model and many blogger have report the price for the steel apple watch to be roughly it be reasonable to assume that the gold edition model will sell for substantially more than this with many suggest or but remember that this price would only cover or ounce of gold even with thin wall and a steel frame it s hard to see how apple could make a solid karat gold case and buckle for a mm watch with just ounce of gold gold be soft but apple claim that their special gold be twice a hard a standard gold take that at face value perhaps they reduce the thickness of the case commensurately cut the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch this still leave a few thousand dollar of material value in the case the apple watch edition will come in mm and mm size a difference of about in term of case volume so the smaller model could sell for le still my prediction be that the mm apple watch edition will retail for with the mm apple watch edition retail for this cover the cost of the gold case the internals manufacture sale and profit and yet do not leave apple subsidize the world gold market by sell at a discount or cheat with a too thin or plat case i will be shock if the price be but i suppose it s possible with some finagle and if that s the smaller model and it will not be any le than that this be a product this be a product bonus prediction give the very high price of the apple watch edition i predict that availability will be quite limit apple will likely create special store within a store space in certain apple store location for the edition i further expect them to open special standalone apple edition boutique to sell the watch edition accessory and perhaps other future high end product update needle to say many people disagree with me and now that gruber fireballed this post i imagine i ll hear from lot of them real soon the gist of the disagreement lie in the amount of gold need for the watch case i assume it would be quite thick read sturdy and would contain upwards of gram of k gold then there s the strap lug and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen gram but gak pdx and others though he be most visually eloquent suspect it contain much le gold i think this number be way too low but it s a good lower bind if the case be very thin and completely hollow and it put the raw gold at about at per gram of k gold although this be admittedly much much lower than my estimate it still illustrate my point that the apple watch edition be not go to be cheap and i think he s way off but time will tell who be right and who be wrong another argument be base on this analysis of a gold rolex watch right off the bat one should point out that gold cost oz when it be write and that watch include a gold bracelet a well something apple be apparently not go to do with the edition that rolex case contain gram of gold alloy but it s much much smaller than the apple watch and it s circular to boot a mm circle be mm in circumference while the mm apple watch be mm in circumference use the magic of math to scale the rolex up into a mm rectangle and we re at gram but that case be also much thinner since we exclude the bezel and the apple watch be pretty slab side so we can probably double this safely and come out with of gold in my mangle square rolex case so there be lower estimate than mine for the amount and value of the gold i can accept that but let s take a step back and think about the final price even if it contain le than of gold how much would it sell for certainly not or you still have to account for the cost of everything else plus the intangible of manufacture and distribution and profit for apple and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold so we re back at the estimate others have make a greg koenig tweet and forbes report if anyone think apple be charge le than k for the edition they be smoke crack regardless of the total it s important to realize that the price of gold be in the driver s seat when it come to price the apple watch edition i d love to be wrong and i look forward to update this piece thank for read

200,breitbart texas report an islamic tribunal use sharia law in texas have be confirm by breitbart texas the tribunal be operate a a non profit organization in dallas one of the attorney for the tribunal say participation and acceptance of the tribunal s decision be voluntary breitbart texas speak with one of the judge dr taher el badawi he say the tribunal operate under sharia law a a form of non bind dispute resolution el badawi say their organization be a tribunal not arbitration a tribunal be define by meriam webster s dictionary a a court or forum of justice the four islamic attorney call themselves judge not arbitrator el badawi say the tribunal follow sharia law to resolve civil dispute in family and business matter he say they also resolve workplace dispute in matter of divorce el badawi say that while participation in the tribunal be voluntary a marry couple cannot be consider divorce by the islamic community unless it be grant by the tribunal he compare their divorce know a talaq a something similar to the catholic practice of annulment in that the church do not recognize civil divorce proceed a end a marriage an examiner com article seem trouble by this this though be a perfectly normal practice within religious group in america el badawi be right that catholic have long go to catholic authority to resolve certain question relate to marriage orthodox jew have long go to jewish religious court such a court be call a beth din both to resolve marital matter and to resolve commercial dispute some protestant sometimes do the same corinthian be often interpret a call for that there be three way in which these tribunal decision have practical effect party respect for the system religious people may often feel personally obligate to follow the judgment of respect authority on their religious law for instance a catholic who doesn t get an annulment might feel obligate not to remarry even if he think that he should have get the annulment simply because he feel that god want him to follow the church s teach and decision social pressure would observant muslim feel pressure to abide by a sharia tribunal s rule when that will affect how their coreligionist business partner neighbor and family member perceive them you bet would orthodox jew feel the same you bet and i expect that christian who operate within sufficiently devout and religiously homogeneous community would have the same reaction for an interest but rare case of the legal system be ask to intervene to stop such social pressure and refuse to do so see paul v watchtower bible tract soc y th cir i think that even in the absence of the free exercise clause that be make in that case but that might be unavailable in many state follow employment division v smith a campaign urge people to shun the excommunicate would be protect under the free speech clause see naacp v claiborne hardware co indeed one common argument in favor of religiosity be that community pressure tend to lead people to abide by religious obligation not to steal not to commit adultery and more the flip side be that community pressure tend to lead people to abide by religious obligation that we might not agree with stay with a husband who mistreat you never remarry and so on of course if there be also the threat of violence and not just community pressure then the law can step in to punish the violence and any explicit threat of violence but the possibility of such violence in rare case doesn t allow the legal system to step in to block nonviolent social pressure in other case the party could also enter into a bind arbitration agreement under which they agree that the tribunal s decision would be enforceable in civil court such agreement be common with secular commercial arbitration even when the arbitration be suppose to apply law other than american law e g english law or french law and they be also permissible for religious arbitration there be interest question about whether an arbitral decision be enforceable in secular american court if it apply substantive or procedural rule that discriminate base on race religion or sex i discus this a bite in this post and the comment to it be also much worth read but accord to the breitbart texas article el badawi say that these tribunal do not conduct legally bind arbitration rather their decision be follow when they be follow a a result of the party acquiescence and community pressure a a result these interest question don t arise here religious community have long have the right to use standard american contract law couple with the standard american liberty to exert social pressure on your family member friend neighbor and business partner to have religious decisionmakers decide dispute that s especially so when the decision be enforce just by community member own religious feel or by social pressure but that can also be so subject to some limitation when the party to the dispute agree to bind arbitration which again doesn t seem to be in play with the texas islamic tribunal the remedy for those who disapprove of the religious law be leave the community or the religion that be of course often very hard for personal and economic reason it s hard for muslim it s hard for orthodox jew and especially group such a the satmar hasid it s hard for mormon jehovah s witness the amish and member of lot of other group but that s a necessary aspect of american social and religious freedom

475,when you complain to your cable company you certainly don t expect that the cable company will then contact your employer and discus your complaint but that s exactly what happen to one former comcast customer who say he be fire after the cable company call a partner at his account firm it begin innocently enough conal begin subscribe to comcast service in early after he say he be sell a month promotional price offer but from the start there be issue with his service a he be be charge for set top box that have yet to be activate additionally someone at comcast bill have misspell conal s last name mean some of his bill be not be deliver he say he meet with a comcast rep in may about the bill issue and promise they would all be sort out but thing only get worse a few month later the promotional discount shrink and conal s monthly bill increase by in addition to still be charge for unactivated device in his house comcast also twice charge him an additional for a second modem he do not have meanwhile attempt to get a resolution from comcast go unanswered cut the cord he attempt to cancel his service in oct but say a comcast rep convince him that the bill issue would be resolve and that he would get free dvr service and the movie channel for three month a compensation but thing didn t just continue a they have before comcast somehow manage to sink even lower than it have before send conal about a dozen piece of equipment that he didn t order there be a few dvrs modem standard box and equipment that i be unfamiliar with he say make matter worse comcast bill him for all this stuff he d never request and have no use for when conal return all the equipment to comcast and be an experience accountant at one of the nation s most prestigious firm even prepare a spreadsheet detail every charge overcharge payment and credit on his account for his brief time a a comcast customer he say even this didn t convince comcast that there be a problem and that conal have be overcharge and even though it wasn t yet past due comcast send conal s account into collection in feb the call in question and so on feb he choose to try go above comcast s customer service which hadn t be of any help in the year he d be a subscriber and instead contact the office of the company s controller he speak to someone in that office who promise conal would receive a call back to address the issue he describe that callback a bizarre with the rep not identify which company she be call from just start out with how can i help you then she keep insist that a technician have show up for an appointment but wouldn t specify which appointment the rep then begin ask him for the color of his house so he try the controller s office again to let them know that the rep they d send his way have fail miserably at her job during this call he say that he mention that comcast s bill and account issue should probably be investigate by the public company account oversight board pcaob a private sector oversight operation this ultimately lead to two service call where no one ever show up and no explanation be give but something do happen just not anything good we know where you work remember how we briefly mention above that conal work for a large prestigious account firm comcast certainly notice that fact especially since that firm be one that do business with comcast at some point shortly after that call someone from comcast contact a partner at the firm to discus conal this lead to an ethic investigation and conal s subsequent dismissal from his job a job where he say he d only receive positive feedback and review for his work comcast maintain that conal use the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage conal insist that he never mention his employer by name but believe that someone in the comcast controller s office look him up online and figure out where he work when he be fire conal s employer explain that the reason for the dismissal be an e mail from comcast that summarize conversation between conal and comcast employee but conal have never see this e mail in order to say whether it s accurate and comcast have thus far refuse to release any tap of the phone call relate to this matter and while his former employer do provide consult service to comcast it be not the account firm that audit comcast s book so conal doesn t quite see how mention the name of his employer would have help gain him any leverage in response to a letter from conal s lawyer he have not file a lawsuit but it s not out of the question comcast s senior deputy general counsel admit that the company do contact conal s employer but say that conal be not in a position to complain that the firm come to learn about his dispute with comcast the heart of the matter i think whether or not conal mention his employer be beside the point the problem should not have reach the point where he be even reach out the comcast controller s office have the bill issue be fix on the first second third fourth fifth or sixth chance that he give comcast to address the issue the call in question would never have happen and even if conal do identify his employer in the hope of get his bill issue fix he wouldn t have be try to get preferential treatment just the service he d pay for i m also curious why even though comcast insist that conal attempt to leverage his place of business to get his issue resolve it have not specifically cite language that he allegedly use in the call how many time a day do comcast rep hear a customer say something like i m a lawyer or i m a big shoot at fill in the blank how many of those result in comcast go out of it way to contact that customer s employer we reach out to comcast to ask whether it s company policy to contact customer employer no one answer that question but a rep for comcast do give a brief statement our customer deserve the best experience every time they interact with u read the statement comcast say it have previously apologize to conal but add we will review his lawyer s letter and respond a quickly a possible

close to first look confirm today over the last year however the center of gravity of the organization have shift a omidyar and his silicon valley braintrust have exert control over budget and vacillate over the journalistic mission over the summer omidyar appoint a longtime confidante john temple a former newspaper editor who previously lead an omidyar finance civic journalism venture in hawaii to be the president for audience and product put him in a position above eric bat the former roll stone editor who be bring on a a first look editorial director who be close to taibbi the leave of absence also come three month after i first report that omidyar have apparently order taibbi to change his strategy away from purely cover corporate fatcats like uh pierre omidyar to a wider mission involve more comedy than report around the same time i hear rumor that eric bat be also unhappy at the organization i ve previously have a uh spirit email conversation with taibbi about both claim although taibbi would only engage on the condition that his word be not for publication a strange demand come from an editor at a site that s about leak confidential document i email taibbi again today to ask if i can publish his response in the light of today s news he reply no you may not here then for what little it s worth be my side of the correspondence from back in july in which i lay out the state of first look a i saw it with a little help from some well place source the discussion be uh spirit on both side all word below be mine you ll just have to try to infer what taibbi s state position might have be a note on not for publication off the record i think carefully about the ethic of publish even my half of a not for publication conversation give first look s own policy of publish confidential document and the fact that it seem clear taibbi wasn t be entirely truthful about his place at the company i ultimately come down on the side of publish my own response with taibbi s word redact i m sure some reader with disagree i welcome the discussion also an important disclosure taibbi previously work with pando s mark ames on russian ex pat newspaper the exile it have be widely report that the two be no longer on speak term i didn t discus this post with mark before publish ok here be the email the email thread begin with taibbi's email me to deny that omidyar have change his strategy i have email first look for comment on my story before publication but receive no reply taibbi's email be head not for publication from paul carr to matt taibbi date tue jul redact taibbi quote deny my story right but that s not the part that seem to have change what s change be that omidyar s description of the site yesterday make zero mention of wall street it s go from finance first to politics first more broadly and happy to stay off the record there s clearly something weird go on over there why do a m journalism project have to shift focus before it s launch it suggest po have no clue how to handle talent and so be retreat back to technology taibbi respond with question of his own here's my reply from paul carr to matt taibbi date tue jul i don t think omidyar take you aside and order you not to cover his friend i think either you make the decision yourself for reason of an easier life or his blog post be the first you hear about the change and he just publicly fuck you over know what i do about his management style i m lean towards the latter but i email you because i actually want to understand what s go on taibbi respond again and i reply again from paul carr to matt taibbi date tue jul redact if i wait for pierre and his staffer to respond to question i d never publish a thing about first look i ve give po hr to respond before and still get nothing i m sure you ve always hold story indefinitely until you receive a response a for your bizarre chain of straw man argument i didn t say he d hire you to shut you up so no i don t believe something you just make up a you say that would be real redact analysis here s what i believe i don t think pierre have any idea why he hire you and i don t think you re entirely sure either perhaps he be look for name that look good on a press release and you fit the bill i think you re tire and i think you know the roll stone gig wasn t go to last for ever i think po offer you complete editorial freedom and promise you a blank check to build your own team for that reason i think omidyar s announcement yesterday should be terrify to you and to anyone else who work at flm he s lose his nerve for a combination of reason and be retreat to something he understand technology and platform i ve speak to people who have know omidyar for decade and people who have work with him on previous publication if you seriously think he s go to have your back when you go after his pal you re more naive than well than you be i m tire of this conversation now i honestly can t tell if you re be a team player or if you believe any of this crap i m sure i ll continue to cover flm and i ll continue to ask for comment when i do it s entirely up to you if you respond before publication or wait until afterwards and then bitch on twitter either way i ll continue to read your wall st stuff if when you publish it just a i read and enjoy your most recent book on a long flight a few week back best of luck paul taibbi respond again from paul carr to matt taibbi date wed jul i m tire of it because you refuse to actually engage in conversation i ve lay out my position clearly and honestly and ask follow up question you win t actually address any of my point you just keep lob back straw men and not engage with what i m say at the very least you ve turn into a corporate flack for first look continue to hammer away at a caricature version of what i say while refuse to answer question and demand that the whole thing stay off the record so that reader continue to be leave in the dark the last person who try that line of attack over a pando story be lanny davis redact i ve tell you what i believe but i ll humor you and your enjoyment at play pr flack by say it again this time line by line redact taibbi quote i think it s unlikely pierre order you to stop write about wall street i d say the odds be almost zero he s not that fuck stupid here s what i say no of course i don t think he take you aside and order you not to cover his friend i think either you make the decision yourself for reason of an easier life or his blog post be the first you hear about the change and he just publicly fuck you over here s my question which you don t seem keen to answer do you know pierre be go to leave finance out of his post about what your editorial mission would be if not doesn t that worry you if so what be the reason behind not mention the thing that you be best know for but which be likely to make your sole funder and bos the most uncomfortable a follow up question what be we to make of the fact that first look journalist greenwald in particular insist that pierre have no control over editorial indeed you ve insist similar in this conversation and yet he s the one lay out the company s editorial plan why wouldn t that be the job of the actual editor instead we have your m funder issue a statement that marginalize the one aspect of your work that might sting him while reassure the world that don t worry he intend to permit you and greenwald to continue do your job but that he have decide to axe plan for all the other editorial sit he previously in a video star him say he would fund what do the phrase editorial independence actually mean at first look redact taibbi quote i think that s what he tell you when you be first hire yes people be tell lot of thing on first date redact taibbi quote i ve never say otherwise that s a total red herring redact taibbi quote redact i didn t mention anything in my story about pierre order you to stop write because a i ve make clear i don t believe that would make any sense i didn t mention what i suspect you might have be tell when you be hire because again i don t know what i know and what i write be that the public statement about your mission have change i didn t mention it be a satirical publication because that hasn t change redact taibbi quote a press release about what your job and focus will be write by the man who write your pay check and who be back down on almost all of the editorial strategy that be in place when you be hire a press release that be at odds with all previous statement about what your focus will be specifically leave out the one thing that would seem to have the potential to make omidyar most concern yes i believe that mean you will be focus far le on that aspect of thing and yes i believe that it s either a choice you ve consciously make or a choice pierre be attempt to make for you through passive aggressive public message your choice of denial be interest redact that s the same line greenwald use when he be challenge on whether he would write about pierre s business interest clear enough to sound like a denial but general enough to allow you to focus most of your energy away from wall street do you at least concede that previously the chief focus of your site be to be on finance and now it s on politics and culture if the main focus of the site still on uncover financial corruption yes or no if yes why do your bos mischaracterize the site so badly in his blog post and if no why not redact taibbi quote pierre have be interfere with first look s editorial plan from the start every single editorial plan first look have exist only at pierre s pleasure he be your sole funder and he be the one make public statement about how he intend to allocate those resource how be it possible you understand wall street so well but don t understand that redact taibbi quote yes that be what s apparent from omidyar s statement redact taibbi quote i have plenty of information and print what i know after give you the opportunity to respond before publication i d have plenty more information to set the record straight if you d answer any of the question above or better still stop hide behind not for publication why if you re be so unfairly malign win t you let any of the above be share with reader isn t the whole basis of first look to make all the information public and let reader decide why doesn t that apply to conversation about first look and it billionaire owner which lead me to my last question have you or any first look staffer to the best of your knowledge sign an nda or non disparagement contract either a a standalone or a part of your employment contract s you re right this be an enjoyable conversation now let s shift it up a gear and get to some real answer paul despite previously say he be enjoy our conversation taibbi stop respond when i ask him he have sign any kind of contract restrict his freedom to talk openly about first look when i email him earlier today i ask if he have anything to add to his previous comment he reply just that your story be wrong then and still be

1123,the very first nonsense i have to debunk in be a claim that on jan of that year a planetary alignment would cause gravity to decrease allow you to float momentarily or fall more slowly if you jump in the air at the right moment zero g day this exact same hoax have resurface this week in a couple of place so i ve decide to update the debunk to include some new link and repost it hopefully to stem the tide of silliness at year s end it seem fit that hopefully this be also the last debunk i ll make in but who know there s still a week leave something you ll never hear me say well now i ve hear it all long experience have teach me there be always a sillier claim always and you re hear that from a guy who have debunk the idea that the maya calendar predict the end of the world that the supermoon cause earthquake and that a magnetic pole flip of the earth will cause superstorms and another say the earth be already physically start to flip over so what s sillier than these well we now have the claim that early next year on jan at pst to be exact due to the combine gravity of jupiter and pluto you will be able to jump in the air and float for just a couple of second or at least fall more slowly depend on different source it s hard for me to overstate just how wrong this claim be first off this exact same hoax be pull last year in by a site call news hound now offline apparently and a lot of people fell for it here we be again a year later back at the same spot this time the joke be be make by a news site call daily buzz live which didn t even bother to change much of the word of the original hoax they even have a picture of a nasa tweet about the event there s only one problem that picture be completely fake nasa never tweet it and it be presumably make up wholesale for the article on daily buzz live whoever do it be clever add the number of retweets and favorite but it s a fake a a iphone you can buy on the street in new york city after all the physic of zero g day be wrong the claim about pluto and jupiter be wrong and and this part be the real killer it s base on a joke make by an astronomer nearly year ago despite this it s spread around facebook and twitter so much once again that i get a lot of people ask or tell me about it that s why i m debunk this thing again so to get start here s the claim it have be reveal by the british astronomer patrick moore that on the morning of january th an extraordinary astronomical event will occur at exactly be the planet pluto will pas directly behind jupiter in relation to the earth this rare alignment will mean that the combine gravitational force of the two planet would exert a stronger tidal pull temporarily counteract the earth s own gravity and make people weigh le moore call this the jovian plutonian gravitational effect yeah except this be all baloney to be polite ok so why be this wrong pluto and jupiter sit in a tree first of all the gravitational force of the other planet in the solar system have essentially zero effect on you personally and we re do full stop ok fine i ll give some brief detail the planet be big object with lot of gravity but that only affect you if you re close to them space however be big that s why we call it space and planet be far away this weaken their gravity on you hugely reduce it to le than the impact of the flutter of a butterfly s wing if you want the math then here you go even if you add all of the planet together they pull on you with a force le than percent of that of the moon the daily buzz live article mention tide too but that s even worse the combine tidal force from the planet be far le like percent of the moon s simply put the planet be just too far away to have any real effect on you by the way the moon orbit the earth on an ellipse so it own gravity fluctuate far more than the combine strength of the planet every two week note that you cannot float in the air every two week and specifically the gravity from pluto be weakest of them all pluto be a teeny tiny ice ball far smaller than even our moon and at it closest it s flippin billion kilometer billion mile from earth that s a long way a car on the road half a kilometer away have more gravitational pull on you than pluto do in fact do the math i find that the earth pull on you about trillion time harder than pluto do that's about the same ratio a the number of cell in your body to a single cell so this claim that you can float be like say you can shed a single cell and fly away by flap your arm location it get worse amazingly the article say pluto will be directly behind jupiter on jan i check on that day they be on nearly opposite side of the sky they re really far apart about you couldn t have pick a much worse date to claim pluto be behind jupiter so the physic of the claim be ridiculous but the origin of the claim make it even funnier fool me once shame on you the article on daily buzz live mention that this claim come from patrick moore he be a real astronomer in the u k an enormously popular radio and television science program presenter he predate carl sagan and be still consider an icon of science in england the wonderful thing about all this be moore actually do make this claim however a snopes com point out it be an april fools' day joke moore make this claim in on his radio program to my complete unsurprise apparently some folk call in to say they do feel the effect this be call prim where you tell people in advance that they ll feel something due to some cause and they will even if the cause never happen it s use by ghost hunter and ghost tour guide quite a bite to spook people before they actually enter a haunt house guarantee they ll feel chill a they walk from room to room i ve see this myself first hand people can convince themselves of amaze thing that never actually happen hope float so there you go it s a repeat of a silly claim base on a joke in the first place i know a lot of people read this right now be slap their forehead and wonder how people can be so stupid a to fall for this i understand this reaction but i don t share it smart people fall for silly thing all the time and intelligence isn t really the prime factor here skepticism be in general school don t teach people how to analyze a claim how to tell if something make sense on the surface of it or how to go about look into the claim i know right away to do the math and to see if pluto and jupiter really be align a the article say but all too often people don t think carefully or at all about these claim and simply spread them through social medium all it take be literally the click of a share button pseudoscience thrive via this virulence whereas truth must take a harder path in fact that s why i bother debunk stuff like this sure this be a silly claim and probably harmless in practice but not all of them be i already mention the mayan notpocalypse from and i can tick off a dozen other doomsday or scary claim that spread due to a lack of skepticism and of course there be real issue like global warm denial anti vaccination and more which live and breathe and spread due to a lack of skepticism in the public in my original post about this in january i say this particular bite of fluff will dry up and float away in a day or two but those others be here to stay for a long time i be wrong and i should ve know that something like this would resurface again in a year it s like the mar a big a the moon nonsense that come back year after year still my hope be that every time we take a moment to inject a bite of polite skepticism into people s everyday live it make the world a slightly better place to be if enough of u do it often enough we can change slightly to magnificently

redesign new colour thinner design on january to mac post a series of image that it say show the next macbook air's radical new design new in macbook air design mockups by to mac advertisement bear in mind that these be artist's render rather than photo of the real thing although we're sure you'll agree that they're extremely well do the artist be michael steeber to mac commission the image base on information it acquire from source within apple who have use internal prototype version of the upcoming computer it isn't entirely clear how much of the design come from the source and how much from the artist's imagination although many of the most major change to the keyboard layout for instance be obviously in the former category sure enough the new design be for a laptop with a new screen size inch yet the slimming process in these design be so extreme that the new in macbook air actually have a smaller body than the exist in macbook air the screen be a little bigger but everything around the screen have be shrink here accord to the render at any rate be how the new in macbook air leave will compare to the current in macbook air right new in macbook air design mockups by to mac this also partly illustrate the biggest bombshell in these leak the new design find space for only one port on each side of the laptop it have a usb port on the righthand edge the new smaller and reversible type c usb and a headphone socket along with a couple of microphone hole on the leave if this be right the macbook will have to be power via the usb port and sure enough usb type c will be perfectly adequate for that purpose it just mean that you won't be able to use a usb hard drive wire mouse or wireless mouse dongle or other usb accessory while the macbook be plug in macworld contributor kirk mcelhearn be one of the sceptic who have point out the numerous inconvenience this would impose and it's possible likely we would say that the eventual layout will be le extreme we think the magsafe power connection be likely to survive a we mention briefly the keyboard be also design differently the power button now sit next to the esc key at the top leave corner of the

be sure the claim be legitimate marsh have a rumour about the macbook air to add to an earlier rumour that suggest the new model would come in gold silver and space grey finish more on that below now he claim his source have tell him that the new design be so thin apple have have to switch to a new reversible usb type c connector which be significantly smaller than usb it's x mm apparently the magsafe port be also get a redesign for the same reason the laptop chassis be too thin to accomodate the current magsafe charger indeed the macbook air may charge in an entirely new way although marsh's source wasn't clear on whether this have be finalise yet the macbook air be also say to feature thin bezel with a keyboard that stretch to the edge of the laptop marsh also claim his source tell him the display bezel be noticeably thinner quite similar to the current macbook pro retina lineup marsh's earlier report claim that the new macbook air will come in iphone like space grey and gold finish a well a the usual aluminium macrumors lend some credibility to this inisial report claim that they be aware that apple have at least consider launch the in notebook with several different 'special edition' colour option and it wouldn't be the first time apple have introduce a range of colour choice on their mac laptop advertisement new retina macbook air rumour inch screen many of the new macbook air rumour suggest this model will feature a in screen some source point to evidence that apple be work with in screen but there have be claim that quantum computer will be build a rumour inch ipad later this year and it could be the ipad pro that be be refer to here accord to a digitimes report in june source claim apple wish to introduce a smaller macbook air to make clearer the distinction between the inch macbook air and the ipad air with it inch screen canalys analyst daniel matte also believe apple be work on a new version of the macbook air one with a in screen other rumour place the screen size at in which probably match matte's expectation in his blog matte seem to be suggest that there may only be one macbook air this new inch model with the inch model be phase out in favour of the inch macbook pro with retina display kgi security analyst ming chi kuo suggest back in october that apple will launch a inch macbook air in kuo suggest that this new macbook air would have an entirely new design the smaller in model could still accommodate a reasonably size screen and keyboard if it have a smaller bezel new retina macbook air rumour fanless design the new macbook air be also say to be even thinner than the exist macbook air this be base on the theory that it will use intel's new intel core m processor a chip that doesn't need fan by use this processor it be claim that apple could make the laptop mm thin the macbook air be currently cm thick so it could be almost cm thinner at it thickest point apparently the fan assembly be the reason why the macbook air be thicker at one end than the other remove the fan assembly would enable apple to make the laptop thinner than ever accord to report presumably there will be some sort of cool system build in but that may not be necessary the new intel processor be say to be efficient enough to make the removal of the fan feasible indeed there be already laptop on the market that do not feature a fan even the core m may still require cool in a in laptop though the new broadwell processor should enable a fanless design for the smaller up to in laptop or mobile device note motley fool base on what intel say at it developer forum in it have be suggest that the macbook air could also offer thermal scale and thermal management another advantage of a fanless design would be quiet operation there would also be no move part make it le likely to break and it could also offer higher battery capacity because the remain space could be use to house a bigger battery we can't help but worry that history could repeat itself if the macbook air be fan free steve job famously refuse to include a fan in the apple i lead to hardware failure new retina macbook air rumour usb type c if marsh's source above be correct the new macbook air may offer usb type c support which be smaller than usb it's x mm usb type c be able to support gbps data transfer which be twice a fast a usb but still slower than thunderbolt although the same a the older thunderbolt it will also support for up to watt of power which be apparently enough to power k display a apple's thunderbolt cable do currently the only problem be that usb type c isn't backwards compatible new retina macbook air rumour inductive charge marsh's source also claim that the magsafe port may get a redesign and that the macbook air may charge in an entirely new way perhaps the new macbook air will use inductive charge like the apple watch do advertisement new retina macbook air rumour trackpad change accord to a report on chinese site weiphone earlier this year the new macbook air will be thinner and lighter a feat it will achieve by remove the fan and the click mechanism in the trackpad the new in model will drop the trackpad and introduce force and optical sensor and new touch gesture accord to this report from ben latest news new retina macbook air rumour retina display will the next macbook air feature a retina display that's one of the strongest and most persistent rumour and it's certainly possible apple may opt to keep price down and battery life up by keep the screen non retina but we don't think so accord to our own review of the macbook air the macbook air be currently let down by it display which have a lower resolution than the competition canalys analyst daniel matte have write a blog claim that apple will add a retina display to the macbook air this year he expect that we will see a inch model with a resolution of x pixel the same ppi that the ipad air offer he explain the significance of apple use the same display technology for the macbook air and ipad air state it turn out that an retina macbook air with a x resolution happen to have the exact same pixel density a the x retina ipads ppi it would make sense for apple to take advantage of the same display technology it have be utilize for the ipads by cut their panel to this larger size rumour also claim that the new macbook air retina display could have a resolution of x for a rumour in display discus below that's pixel per inch compare to pixel per inch for the in macbook pro which offer by resolution this add up to a aspect ratio like that find on the in macbook air and macbook pro model rather than the aspect ratio currently offer by the in macbook air the current inch macbook air offer a x pixel display the rumour of a macbook air with retina display have be long run back in february rumour suggest that apple be plan to launch a revamp macbook air with a retina display in the third quarter of a separate report in march also claim that apple would introduce a retina display to the macbook air in since this didn't happen in it be perhaps likely for apple do appear to be move the whole of it range to retina display the company update the retina version of it macbook pro in and also introduce a retina ipad mini in october wonder what the retina display fuss be all about read what's a retina display and what's a retina hd display apple may use the igzo display technology for the new display offer improve power efficiency the reason for the supposition be that apple be recruit for a engineer with experience in lead backlighting and lcd display in february accord to cultofmac in an lcd display the bunch of pixel with wire run behind to connect them the backlight have to shine though this mesh of wire to light up the pixel in an igzo display more light be able to shine though this mesh of wire so the power requirement be lower and battery life can be preserve a a result we could see even longer battery life than the hour currently on offer from the in macbook air advertisement rumour about a retina macbook air with a smaller display have be circulate for some time kgi security analyst ming chi kuo suggest back in october that apple will launch a inch macbook air in kuo suggest that this new macbook air would have an entirely new design then back in january evercore partner analyst patrick wang predict that a in macbook ipad hybrid would launch in the autumn of it be possible that the rumour retina display macbook air could be this mac canalys analyst daniel matte also believe apple will add a retina display to the macbook air this year new retina macbook air rumour processor intel have announce the new intel core m chip some expect that this processor may be use by apple inside the new macbook air a mention above because this chip doesn't need fan the new macbook air could be le than a centimeter thick at it thickest point since it use the nm processor the processor itself it be tiny the core m processor should also enable the new macbook to be more power efficient with better battery life intel claim it's the most energy efficient chip yet the core m also offer excellent graphic process power accord to intel intel say it will offer seven time the graphic power of four year old machine and double the graphical and three time the web performance of the current range of high end tablet however intel have not confirm that apple will use the new processor in the press release regard the new chip intel mention acer asus dell hp lenovo and toshiba a potentially use the core m some of these model will be available in october accord to intel the core m be design for small laptop large tablet and in device and intel be position the chip a be for use in laptop of in tablet above in and dual device apple would traditionally use the core i chip in it macbook so it be possible that these processor will never appear in a macbook air which may instead use the new u broadwell processor which may not ship until redmond pie report that performance with the core m hasn't be particularly impressive it be feature in the lenovo yogo pro which didn't exactly set the world alight benchmark speed test and overall review rat the device quite poorly it's therefore be suggest that apple may give the core m a miss and go instead for an i or i chip on the other hand some analyst have argue that lenovo's implementation of the core m rather than the innate quality of the core m itself be to blame for the sub standard performance and that apple's engineer would be able to coax solid performance from a core m equip macbook air we shall see whichever broadwell processor apple do use it should make the retina display macbook air possible broadwell be say to consume percent le power than it predecessor haswell and that should be good news for battery life on the portable mac especially those with power hungry screen other feature of the broadwell chip be that it be low power and offer integration with widi g wwan and wigig network advertisement new retina macbook air rumour may not use intel chip this rumour have be float around for some time it be possible that apple will ditch the intel processor in it range of laptop in favour of it own home make a series chip like those find in the ipad and iphone some have even speculate that the new macbook air could mark some sort of crossover between the ipad and the macbook perhaps an ipad pro however rumour that apple will move from intel to arm chip seem unlikely base on this explaination from cult of mac new retina macbook air rumour uk price with the price of the macbook air and macbook pro with retina display be so close we have expect that apple would reduce the price of the entry level macbook even further it's currently for the in model which be le than in this compare to the macbook pro retina start price of however the fact that the top of the range iphone plus cost more than the entry level macbook air make u think that the macbook air price be more likely to increase it may be that the inch macbook air be discontinue a that model be similar in price to the inch macbook pro with retina but not equal in spec this would leave the cheaper inch macbook air model with potentially an entry level price of when it first launch in october the inch macbook pro with retina display start at this be reduce to a few month later when the range receive a processor upgrade now with the april update to the macbook air the entry level price of the inch model be a much more compel which make the difference between the inch macbook pro with retina display and the inch macbook air rather than in his prediction last year kgi security analyst ming chi kuo suggest that the price of this new inch macbook air model could be lower than the current line up of mac laptop read which inch macbook should i buy didn't apple already introduce the macbook air apple unveil the latest update to the macbook air on april quietly update it macbook air line up with improve haswell processor from intel you can read our review of the in macbook air and the review of the in macbook air here aside from the small processor boost and a tiny battery life tweak the main change for the new macbook air model be the price each model be now under with price start at le than the previous model this help keep the macbook air an attractive option for customer a the previous price be not much different to the price of the new macbook pro with retina display the range update come a some surprise a the retina display for the macbook air rumour be already in circulation prior to the macbook air update in april there be suggestion that the new macbook air with retina display could launch at wwdc but this be obviously not the case read our reason to buy a macbook air and reason not to buy a macbook air apple have update it macbook air and retina macbook pro for read more here inch retina macbook pro review inch retina macbook pro review in macbook air review macbook air review in why be the retina macbook air delay if there be a delay the key reason may be the availability of intel processor rather than the production of the new design intel's newest generation of chip the successor to the haswell chip currently in the macbook air call broadwell have be plague by delay however in a conference call about intel's second quarter result on july intel's chief executive brian krzanich confirm intel s hardware partner will have broadwell system on store shelve in the run up to christmas he say we say we would have product on shelve for the holiday season and we continue to work with our partner and we re on schedule to have product on shelf in the holiday a we mention above some of these new chip be now ship however anyone await the new retina macbook pro macbook air imac and mac mini should note that there be various broadwell chip be develop by intel and the chip that intel confirm be ship now be the m variety destine for fanless two in one the new macbook air may use the u broadwell processor which may not ship until we be sure that apple be pretty frustrate with intel shipment of skylake the successor to broadwell which will offer even more power than that chip be also delay new retina macbook air release date will the macbook air be an ipad pro there be also rumour that apple could launch a in ipad but this might not arrive until or the rumour could relate to the in macbook there be also rumour that the new macbook air merge with the ipad to create the ipad pro you can read more about the ipad pro rumour here we think that a macbook air that offer a dual boot system for io and mac o x would be very interest however tim cook last year rule out any kind of convergence suggest that a toaster refrigerator wouldn't work will the old non retina macbook air remain if apple launch a in macbook air will it discontinue the exist model it's possible that if apple launch a in retina macbook air model it will discontinue both or either of the exist model equally apple could maintain one of the exist model a an entry level model it seem more likely that it would keep the in model on at an even lower price rather than keep on the bigger in model one reason why apple may keep a lower price macbook air on be the fact that apple have just introduce a new entry level imac and already the macbook air look superior to that despite cost le if apple want a low end option it would appear unlekely that the retina macbook air would be it read our review of the new imac and see how it compare to the macbook air the new macbook air will be solar power ok so this be a bite of an out there rumour but it really be possible that apple will one day release a new macbook air with a solar power display in january apple be grant a patent that describe a method for harness sunlight to illuminate a macbook's display this patent be actually the seventh solar relate patent apple have gain in the past two year new retina macbook air leak image at present there be no new macbook air leak image to share with you but we will update this story a soon a one

1368,jeny chang for buzzfeed via drug policy alliance data new york city the new york police department will no longer arrest people for low level marijuana possession accord to people with knowledge of the city s drug strategy who speak on condition of anonymity the nypd will issue violation summons to people catch with marijuana instead of put them in handcuff and take them to a precinct the summons will require people to appear in court at a later date and pay a fine few detail on the new policy be immediately available but an official with one of the city s five district attorney office confirm to buzzfeed news on monday that the change be happen the official add that burn marijuana would still be cause for arrest but that have the drug in a public place would not the nypd and mayor bill de blasio s office do not immediately respond to request for comment but be expect to officially announce the new policy at a news conference on monday manhattan district attorney cyrus vance say monday he support the change two year ago and still do this policy by divert thousand of case from criminal court will also keep low level offender particularly teen from an arrest and all it attendant consequence include a night or more in jail he say the new policy which be first report by the new york time would bring about a sea change in the way the city be police misdemeanor level marijuana possession account for a large percentage of the city s arrest a vast majority of which happen to young black or latino men live in poor neighborhood some public defender praise the policy this be a huge improvement lisa schreibersdorf executive director of brooklyn defender service tell buzzfeed news summons don t get you fingerprint this will be better for people who be vulnerable to collateral consequence like immigrant still schreibersdorf caution that the policy will not fulfill it goal unless the nypd relax it identification requirement for summons immigrant and teenager often do not carry valid identification she say which often mean that they cannot be process for a summon she add that the policy do not address the root cause of the problem namely that police officer in new york routinely stop people without probable cause have summons be an improvement for people who be already be stop but that doesn t mean they should be stop in the first place she say the problem from my perspective be that stop people without cause be unconstitutional advocate also warn that the new policy could result in an increase number of arrest warrant which be issue to people who fail to show to court for a summon a the new york time report up to a quarter of people issue summon fail to appear for their court appointment a a consequence there be currently million open bench warrant in new york city about one per every eight resident possession of le than gram of marijuana have not be a crime in new york state since the nypd make arrest for misdemeanor possession in under current law the only way to get arrest and charge with a misdemeanor for have le than gram of marijuana be to display it in public view the legal definition of that term however be ambiguous public view can mean smoke pot in a public place but it can also mean that a police officer stop you frisk you and pull a small bag of marijuana from your pocket when the bag leave your pocket it have technically enter public view and the officer can legally arrest you and charge you with a misdemeanor even though you have le than the decriminalize amount this broad interpretation of public view help low level marijuana possession become one of the nypd s most commonly use arrest charge during stop and frisk the correlation between marijuana arrest and stop and frisk become apparent after when a u s district court declare the police tactic an unconstitutional form of racial profile by the nypd be make only marijuana possession arrest still a large number but le than in a recent study by the nonprofit drug policy alliance find that upwards of of all low level marijuana arrest make in affect black people or latino even though national study have show that white people be just a likely to smoke marijuana regularly and slightly more likely to have try it the report also find that the geography of the arrest be highly segregate with dominantly white neighborhood see fewer arrest than neighborhood of color with similar per caput income these stark race and class disparity in drug law enforcement become a sore point for mayor de blasio who a a candidate promise to end discriminatory police they also drive ken thompson the brooklyn district attorney to announce in july that his office would no longer prosecute low level marijuana possession opt instead to dismiss most of such case still the nypd defend the high number of arrest with willam bratton de blasio s police commissioner say that thompson s decision would not affect the nypd s approach to marijuana possession the policy to be announce on monday will mark the first time the current administration will take concert action to address the disparity in marijuana arrest in an interview with the new york time thompson say he be worry that the new policy could harm those it be intend to help by remove prosecutor from the picture this be because a prosecutor can opt to dismiss a misdemeanor but cannot do the same for a violation but a new report by the vera institute show prosecutorial review can cut both way the institute analyze data provide by the manhattan district attorney and find that black people and latino be much more likely to receive a sentence offer include a jail of prison term than white defendant in similar circumstance in the case of misdemeanor marijuana possession the vera report find black people arraign in manhattan be more likely to receive jail or prison time than people from all other ethnicity by contrast defendant arrest in brooklyn could expect their case to be dismiss the new policy be expect to standardize procedure across the city more detail on the new policy be expect soon de blasio and bratton be schedule to make an announcement together monday at p m this be a

1594,update the story have be update to reflect new evidence and analysis from expert news have be circulate about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just hour or so before the close flyby of m asteroid rc lead some to suggest that the two event be relate however accord to expert who have be examine the evidence include those at nasa the two event be completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with object fall from space accord to the nicaraguan news site el digital com an explosion occur around p m saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produce a crater that be over metre foot wide and about metre foot deep in a wooded area just to the west of the city's international airport and just south of the pan american highway the video below from rt com show military personnel investigate the crater a well a the surround area for potential debris from the explosion while the incident be still be investigate official with nicaragua's institute of territorial study inet which monitor earthquake activity in the country say that the event show up on the agency's seismic instrument we be convince that this be a meteorite we have see the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet say in a press conference accord to agence france presse afp you can see two wave first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which be the impact of the sound however while there have be report of people hear the explosion the scientist have the seismic data from it and they have the result crater there be part of the story that just don't add up a metre wide asteroid name rc pas by earth on sunday fly underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there be roughly a hour difference in the time of these two event some saw a potential connection between these event it's not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there be over know near earth asteroid fly around the sun and very likely million that we haven't detect and likely won't because they're too small while most of these follow their own path a they circle the sun not all be alone some asteroid have tiny moon orbit them some be best describe a 'rubble piles' which be group of smaller object only barely hold together into a boulder like shape by their mutual gravity others can be travel along in 'packs' with some member precede or lag behind the 'pack leader' possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid 'packs' be fly by or an asteroid that still have debris from a past impact travel along the same orbit it be possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the grind however just because two event an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact happen close to one another doesn't mean that they be relate we saw this back in mid february when we be watch asteroid da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid explode over chelyabinsk russia the exact time and trace orbit of these two object quickly show that they be completely separate object and the time be a just coincidence accord to nasa's jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appear to be the case for this event a meteorite without the meteor an interest fact about this suppose 'impact' be that although the explosion be hear throughout the area apparently nobody witness any bright light associate with it when a meteoroid enter the atmosphere even if it be just a speck of dust it be travel so fast typically around kilometre per second or over km h that it heat up the air in front of it cause the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger object cause even brighter flash earn them the name fireball or even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these be so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day a they pas overhead give the weather over managua on saturday night scatter cloud and calm wind it would have be very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide light up their night sky especially when it happen near a city of over million people accord to the associate press strauch say it be very strange that no one report a streak of light we have to ask if anyone have a photo or something be it something else this lack of a fireball be a stick point in the story while nearly all meteorite go through a 'dark flight' phase during the final part of their journey to earth's surface after it have slow down enough that it isn't compress the air enough to cause it to glow their fireball or bolide stage happen far up in the atmosphere some to kilometre above the grind make them visible far and wide across the countryside geoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channel's meteorite men tweet his thought about the possibility of this be authentic notkin further comment that if it be meteorite relate he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic boom during the object's dark flight and then the impact he also say that to produce a crater like the one see it would have to be an iron meteorite a they be the densest and have form the majority of know meteorite crater on earth in an interview with national geographic donald yeoman the author of near earth object find them before they find u say there be no obvious optical fireball or debris trail see prior to the explosion so it seem unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua be relate to a meteorite impact so what be this if it wasn't a meteorite one very real possibility be that it be a landmine explosion a there be still thousandsin ca bury throughout the country remnant

1692,they haven t verify that the record be what it claim to be but with competition for this story among the medium so ferocious go figure that they d choose to put it on the air and worry about authenticity later a of last night the fbi be investigate between the guy s ip and the fact that the video file be presumably timestamped i assume they ll be able to verify or debunk it quickly it could be a prank the man who record it seem to be er enjoy a video chat while it happen but what he s catch say be tame if you be go to prank cnn by get them to air something sexually explicit in the name of report news you d be more explicit than this no if it s authentic it tell u how many shot be fire the man s attorney tell don lemon she hear shot i hear a forensic examiner who listen to the tape tell cnn he hear at least six shot follow by a pause follow by four more the autopsy report from the family s forensic pathologist claim brown be hit at least six time all from the front that mean that he be hit at least twice in the first flurry of six shot hear here and furthermore that he be face wilson at some point during that flurry it s bizarre to me that brown would have turn back to face a man who be still in the process of fire at him at fairly close range but i don t know what other conclusion can be draw base on what we know the fact that brown have apparently be wound before the fateful pause during which he either rush wilson or try to surrender be also important the prosecution will argue that wilson have already draw blood should have realize that a weaken brown be no longer a much of a physical threat wilson will argue that he felt threaten precisely because brown allegedly keep come after he be wound a man strong enough to take two shot and angry enough about it to advance on a cop with a gun be lethally dangerous he ll say here s how brown s friend dorian johnson describe what happen to them now in line with the officer s driver s side door they could see the officer s face they hear him say something to the effect of what d you say at the same time johnson say the officer attempt to thrust his door open but the door slam into brown and bounce close johnson say the officer with his leave hand grab brown by the neck at that moment johnson say he fix his gaze on the officer to see if he be pull a stun gun or a real gun that s when he saw the muzzle of the officer s gun i see the barrel of the gun point at my friend he say he have it point at him and say i ll shoot one more time a second later johnson say he hear the first shoot go off johnson say he be within arm s reach of both brown and the officer he look over at brown and saw blood pool through his shirt on the right side of the body the whole time the officer be hold my friend until the gun go off johnson note brown and johnson take off run together there be three car line up along the side of the street johnson say he duck behind the first car whose two passenger be scream crouch down a bite he watch brown run past keep run bro he say brown yell then brown yell it a second time those would be the last word johnson s friend big mike would ever say to him brown make it past the third car then blam the officer take his second shoot strike brown in the back at that point johnson say brown stop turn with his hand up and say i don t have a gun stop shoot accord to johnson then the first shoot to hit brown be fire while wilson be still sit in the squad car struggle with him which at least would explain how brown be hit from the front during the first flurry brown then manage to run three car length before wilson presumably still inside the car fire his second shoot hit brown in the back we know from the autopsy report that the last detail be false after listen to this audio the timeline on the first part seem false too there s virtually no delay between the first and second shot fire certainly not long enough for word to be exchange between brown and johnson unless the audio here pick up after the first shoot be fire i e unless it begin with what s actually the second shoot fire at brown i don t know how to square johnson s account with this here s what the nyt say about what eyewitness have tell police some of the account seem to agree on how the fatal altercation initially unfold with a struggle between the officer darren wilson and the teenager michael brown officer wilson be inside his patrol car at the time while mr brown who be unarm be lean in through an open window many witness also agree on what happen next officer wilson s firearm go off inside the car mr brown run away the officer get out of his car and begin fire toward mr brown and then mr brown stop turn around and face the officer that seem more likely than wilson squeeze off a bunch of round while still inside his car but in that case since there must have be a delay of a second or two between the first shoot that go off inside the car wilson get out of the car take aim at brown and then fire again where s that delay on the audio the first six shot be basically continuous exit question can anything be discern from the length of the pause between flurry johnson say brown put his hand up and try to surrender say i don t have a gun stop shoot wilson s allege friend josie tell dana loesch that brown taunt wilson and then rush him do the length of the pause here rule either of those out

2137,the follow be one of the most unusual medium story of the last year on friday esquire magazine post a blister piece bash espn write by the publication s news editor ben collins it be entitle espn have a problem with woman while the column center on the suspension of bill simmons and stephen a smith the lead produce some exclusive detail about coverage plan for monday night football namely the network would be have a domestic violence panel feature different voice all men our bold emphasis have be add on monday night a panel on a two hour pregame show for monday night football will among other thing address domestic abuse this panel will discus once again the appropriate penalty for hit a woman the panel for that discussion will include the follow people chris berman cris carter mike ditka adam schefter tom jackson keyshawn johnson jon gruden mike tirico stuart scott steve young and ray lewis up to men all between the age of and will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on espn zero woman victim of domestic violence in america be most likely to be woman age when the show have update from the field brief report about injury and the upcoming game they ll cut to female sideline reporter lisa salter and on some week suzy kolber these people be not allow at the table how collins get that information whether through his own source or espn itself be never share with esquire reader nevertheless the men theme keep come back throughout his piece a a tentpole of outrage the existence of espn s men domestic violence panel and the anger towards it spread slowly throughout the weekend deadspin have a nice recap of how far the story reach a it be notice on twitter and reblogged across the internet with one feminist organization even put the network on blast base on the esquire article in a press release of course espn be not have an man domestic violence panel tonight the network have explicitly and publicly call the esquire story false a document below but just examine this story from the outset there be plenty to be skeptical about in esquire s story first of all espn have cover domestic violence and the nfl at length while involve woman in the discussion jane mcmanus have be a consistent presence on espn airwave and espn have a deep bench of female commentator that have talk about the issue on the air you can criticize sport network for not involve woman in more prominent way but espn at least appear to be try to make an effort here mcmanus defend the network on twitter second in light of those tweet there s no mention of suzy kolber who will be one of the host on monday night countdown tonight if there s any panel discussion happen tonight wouldn t she be involve third it s easy to make fun of espn and the gratuitously absurd amount of nfl analyst the network employ but who in their right mind would conduct an person panel on a topic like domestic violence that s not something that even nancy grace and the cable news network would be silly enough to do if we re to believe this esquire story chris berman would be moderate an person panel discussion on domestic violence include everyone from the game announcer to reporter it s nonsensical not even espn would be that dense bristol begin the counter offensive today the network release their coverage plan for monday night countdown tonight and in a move straight out of the espn pr playbook they also highlight woman s contribution to their coverage of the nfl domestic violence crisis a rare public statement from john wildhack one of the highest on the espn executive food chain also dispute the esquire report column rant guesswork contrary to publish report in esquire there be no panel on domestic violence ever plan for tonight s monday night countdown we will present our normal monday night football pre game show with suzy kolber host espn be proud of the work it have do cover the issue of domestic violence and be commit to continue coverage much of that work have be inform by several talented female colleague from our television and espnw platform include hannah storm jemele hill jane mcmanus kate fagan sarah spain and more so how do this happen it s simple haphazard and reckless write at esquire gradually begin to be take a fact there never be plan for an men panel to discus domestic violence on monday night countdown collins merely list the talent that would be work the show and assume the topic would come up at some point during the even in an unbelievable failure in communication through the write word collins explain his position in greater detail on his twitter page that s a pretty far cry from what collins actually write in his article which make it abundantly clear there would be a special domestic violence panel with enough men to field an entire football team up to men all between the age of and will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on espn there s no ambiguity in that statement out of people would read that sentence and think espn would be televise a large all male panel discussion specifically focus on domestic violence tonight how do someone who be a news editor at a major publication blur the line of truth and fiction so badly have collins stick with that last tweet he would have have the basis for a decent column and a valid criticism worth raise but because of the overall sloppiness of the esquire piece that point be miss entirely instead a lot of people have waste a lot of time talk about an men domestic violence panel that never exist
