768,the odds of bring a big league franchise to the city of la vega have always seem long for a lot of reason but that may soon change and it might just be the nhl that bring top level professional sport to sin city a recent report suggest that an nhl team come to la vega isn't so much a pipe dream a it be a certainty tony gallagher of the vancouver province report that commissioner gary bettman who have so often say we're not look to expand or we have no plan for expansion so many time over the last decade be change his tune on expansion more from the province recently the nature of the rhetoric have change so much that the question be become not if but when the league will expand and then the ultimate question will they be able to limit the number of new team to just two source close to the situation have indicate la vega be a do deal the only thing to be determine be which owner will be entitle to proclaim that he bring the first major league sport franchise to sin city do deal sound almost too good to be true and it may be but there have be movement on the expansion front recently update nhl deputy commissioner bill daly deny the report wednesday morning in comment to tva sport expansion to la vega be not in our plan there be absolutely nothing new in that he have admit to tvasports ca and if it be an organization struggle with financial difficulty a the florida panther who move rather in the sin city we have no move in sight whether in the case of the panther or any other team besides reply daly even in light of the league's denial there's still reason to believe the nhl will have to soon expand and city like la vega and another rumor candidate seattle would help expand the league's footprint here's why it's not completely outlandish to envision vega a a future nhl city for one they have two open spot in the western conference to even thing out and bring some competitive balance the eastern conference currently have team while the west have if the nhl expand to the most long rumor top candidate of seattle that would help even thing out it's definitely not a simple a that though another barrier for la vega would have be an arena but that may no longer be an issue the city have be home to minor league hockey for year but now vega be in the process of build a new arena however with the aim of bring either an nhl or nba team to vega mgm and aeg owner of the los angeles king be team up on the project that break grind in la vega in may the new arena be due to open in and will have seat but a project capacity of for hockey the company build the arena icon be also build the edmonton oilers' new arena king great luc robitaille be on hand at the grind break there have long be a desire for la vega to finally get a major league franchise and there be likely more than a few individual out there that would be will to bet on sin city to support a big team but here be the issue that make it seem a little le likely there be other market like quebec city or southern ontario that have long be push for nhl team and would appear safer bet than la vega put team in seattle and la vega would help even out the western conference but there could be an uproar if the nhl go to two more non traditional market while strong canadian market exist to make money hand over fist a recent report from cbc suggest that canada could support three more nhl team the league undoubtedly know that they could get a lot out of more canadian market and also have that new tv right deal with rogers a company that would no doubt love more canadian market that's where a second report come in regard expansion howard bloom of sportsbusinessnews com report that the nhl will expand by four team include la vega seattle quebec city and toronto update in light of daly's comment the timeline sure doesn't seem to add up on this one but it be hardly surprise that the league would come out in strong denial with expansion not in the plan now it doesn't mean it can't be eventually and possibly soon a billion figure for combine expansion fee seem a bite high the last time the nhl expand between and expansion fee be a report million which be a million difference from the previous high in the year since you better believe that number be way up from million either way the nhl stand to gain quite the influx of cash if they can expand the winnipeg jet pay a million relocation fee on top of the report million true north pay to purchase the atlanta thrasher the relocation fee likely wouldn't be in the same range a an expansion fee but it offer a more recent point of reference talk of widespread expansion be a big step away from what commissioner gary bettman tell the la vega review journal in june right now we're not look to expand i know la vega be an important city whether or not it's a city for the nhl to put a team in be still to be determine we have not do any investigate a to whether or not the city could support the nhl or look at potential ownership group if the owner be to approve expansion we would certainly begin look more closely at la vega and other potential market it doesn't shut the door but there's a lot of move part to expansion and you'll never hear the nhl commissioner get ahead of himself it's clear that the gear be in motion on some level though quebec city be already build an arena that be set to be complete by the vega arena will be ready by investor have interest in put an arena in markham ont and hamilton ont have also long be a possible expansion relocation target seattle meanwhile have yet to break grind on an a new arena but there have be some movement recently a real estate mogul victor coleman be add some weight to a potential ownership group he recently meet with chris hansen who be work towards bring an nba team to seattle and have promise the city an arena if successful there be reportedly talk of build the arena if the city secure an nhl team first coleman tell king news in seattle that there be a clear path to bring the nhl to the city a possible team league by be a bite concern however could the international talent pool support it it seem to be a stretch dilute the competition should be a major fear a there be a lot of nhl player right now that be just barely scrap by in a team league you don't have to look any further than a lot of the fourth line in the league thirty two team may even be a stretch at that point but add new player wouldn't be a strain a try to add there be a lot of question leave to be answer and the fact that none of the hockey insider that be usually on top of the big story like this have back up the report yet certainly take a little air out of these excite development expect the nhl to expand by without relocate current team seem a bite overly optimistic but the league be make more money than it ever have and be enjoy grow popularity more expansion be probably at it most likely since when the minnesota wild and columbus blue jacket enter the league and that offer some serious excitement for some possibly hockey hungry market

decide that he want to spend time with his nan and grandad i apologise for not let you know but i do not have a phone number or an e mail for you to let you know the situation i also didn't know your

other than that i don't recall any other confirm invite the only reason derek be angry be because of the fact that the envelope be put into alex's school bag when it have nothing to do with the school he speak to the headteacher about and she say that it's against school policy to do that kind of thing birthday invite be fine but not personal item like i say before no money be mention when we speak

viral hit accord to google translate the original russian version say the bear be scar away when igor vorozhbitsyn s phone begin speak out the current time so yes the phone apparently scar off the bear mid maul but no bieber do vorozhbitsyn change his story in a subsequent interview and realize it be bieber all along or do someone insert a seemingly false justin bieber angle into the story point of bieberfication the bear and bieber story all carry the same picture of vorozhbitsyn they have the same quote of him explain that his granddaughter have put the ringtone on his phone they quote the same wildlife expert sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in it track and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear hey thank for that too perfect quote to round out the story anonymous wildlife expert with no credential the symmetry in the story be because they all use the information contain in a single english language report from a site call the austrian time it s lead by a brit name michael leidig who also own the central european news agency his name be list in the domain owership record for the sit a well a for cen s affiliate agency europics after

write mailonline s story have rack up over share the image be the first clue a to where the story really come from mailonline cite cen a the copyright holder of the image it use but the austrian time story credit pravda with the image on it story a search on the pravda website turn up the original article with it image and bieber le report so how do the austrian time learn of the bieber angle that pravda apparently miss no answer from austrian time cen europics i call the office of the austrian time and first ask to speak with david rogers who be the only person list on the site he be both it ombudsman and it primary sale contact i speak with a woman who say rogers be not in the office when i ask about the story she say she would follow up with their office in russia to get the detail and would call me back i ask if their office there typically rewrite thing from wire and local press a lot of story be find on the wire or in local medium but also from local interview on the grind or we speak to the reporter who write them we speak to police to get thing confirm she say i call her again later that day to ask if she have news from the russian office and she say they be often hard to get ahold of she never get back to me i also call and email leidig owner of both the austrian time cen and europics a man who answer the phone at the cen office say leidig be on vacation in romania leidig who have live in austria for some time say nothing about himself on the cen or time website but he have an extensive wikipedia page in the section about cen it list mailonline a one of it client though that and much of the page itself offer no citation for the claim in leidig self publish a book about ponzi schemer bernie madoff along with detail leidig s journalistic achievement the wikipedia page include this passage leidig be also a campaigner for greater support for journalism which he describe a the coalface of democracy he have campaign in favour of more responsibility from search engine like google to give credit to original source material and also for payment for originator of news argue that if the journalist all go out of business nobody will provide the content worth have the sole link in that passage go to an article on the austrian time still one would hope pravda be therefore earn some revenue from the story and image that cen and the austrian time pluck from it site i contact pravda to ask about the image and the story but have not yet hear back for their part the austrian time cen and europics have stop talk to me after receive no information from their russian bureau i send a detail email thursday with question about the bieber version of the pravda story and it use and possible resale of pravda image no have reply or return my call meanwhile the irresistibly bieberfied version of the story continue to spread entertainment website and news organization give it the quick rewrite treatment and link to each other s version completely obscure the dubious origin of the story too good to check and now i suspect too entrench to ever be really correct

1685,there be few topic in the nhl that get people buzz like expansion and relocation do drop some morsel of news in the dead of august and it s like toss the last bite of a shake shack burger to a flock of pigeon in central park on tuesday tony gallagher and howard bloom chuck their meat and the flock go crazy gallagher say that nhl expansion to la vega be a do deal and then bloom up the ante by claim that the nhl will add vega seattle a second toronto franchise and quebec city by the th anniversary of the league no word on whether the league will begin an aggressive clone program to fill out those roster with nhl level talent protect your comb jonathan toews they re come for dna sample bill daly of the nhl say the four team expansion be not in the nhl's plan because what else be he suppose to say gallagher of the province write with finality that the nhl be come to la vega through expansion source close to the situation have indicate la vega be a do deal the only thing to be determine be which owner will be entitle to proclaim that he bring the first major league sport franchise to sin city and give how dead set against a team in the gamble haven the commissioner be year ago this move into another player friendly state tax free zone represent a considerable about face indeed you know we start get an inkling that bettman have change his tune on la vega when he move one of the league s signature promotional event there in but yes this be a considerable about face indeed so in summary expansion to la vega be a do deal except for the fact that there isn t an ownership group that s be approve by the board of governor nor be there an expansion fee establish for the market that would in theory determine who s will to buy in oh vega parlance look we re all in total squee mode for a team in vega or really any declaration that expansion be go to happen but the proliferation of this do deal report by tony gallagher no le be the most hockey august moment in the history of hockey august for the love of balsillie he actually write the only thing to be determine be the group actually own the team that s like write the penguin be go to trade for a first line winger they just need to find a team that will trade them one be vega a do deal of course not be it likely connect the dot one could draw that conclusion mgm grand and aeg aren t build a million arena to house a carrot top repertoire the nhl didn t structure it realign conference with in the east and in the west to make thing easier for winnipeg and with the nhl pull in record revenue attendance and rat the iron hasn t be hotter to strike for expansion but a we ve note previously about vega it s unlike any other market in professional sport there s unrivaled competition for entertainment dollar many of the people who would attend the game a local fan be work while the game be be play the largest target audience for the team would be the casino who fill the considerable luxury box space in the new arena and tourist who pop in to see a game while in sin city or perhaps get comp d for one it wouldn t surprise u in the least to see the nhl dive into the market despite those mystery just to be first one in and because bettman obviously believe an association with vega bring some level of prestige to the league but what about the other three team bloom of sport business news report later on tuesday that the nhl be go full on expansiongasm by add every city that it s consider add for the last several year four new franchise none through relocation nhl expansion four team add by quebec city toronto seattle and la vega b in expansion fee if you ve be follow the seattle angle you know the situation chris hansen the billionaire not the predator catcher have an arena construction deal with the city that hang on attract an nba team the only hope for an nhl team there first be if hansen have a change of heart and vancouver billionaire victor coleman be work with him to that end then come the real fight convince a city council that have otherwise be apathetic to hockey to turn on the fund faucet for an nhl team s arena then there s quebec city which will have an nhl ready arena next year and have no shortage of financial powerhouse ready to step up for an expansion franchise it s also be the most public and hubristic bid for a team otherwise know a the opposite of how gary bettman like to operate then there s a second team in toronto which remain the best idea out of all of these option then again what medium conglomerate be leave to own a team there the score app and what level of bribery to the leaf would it take to even crack that market bloom believe this will happen because the nhl win t be able to keep itself from collect that expansion franchise windfall and that s a solid a theory a any it make sense that the league would expand quickly before lose that expansion money to another relocation cast an eye at florida and

highly decentralise with a clear division between those responsible for administer territory the terror group control and those who direct it military operation isi have be careful to include many sunni tribal figure in administration precisely to pre empt any u s attempt to trigger a tribal uprise against them a strategy the american pursue against al qaeda in iraq isi s forerunner in with some success target baghdadi be reportedly wound on friday night when american warplane hit a ten car isi convoy like this one southwest of mosul which function a isis's capital in northern iraq file

exemplary terror a well a suicide bomber to destroy enemy command and control centre they also use the destruction of bridge and control flood to shape battlefield to their choose and the deployment of roadside bomb and embed tank to inhibit countermove by their iraqi or kurdish opponent so far the u s response have be to remove the unpopular shia prime minister of iraq to reduce the alienation of the country s sunni and limit effort to restore the fight morale of the iraqi national army which poorly lead effectively flee from this ferocious opponent the only effective obstacle to isi take over the country have be shia militia in baghdad and further south and the kurdish peshmerga in the north although the u s have add a further military adviser bring their total strength to over they have to be careful since the same shia militia be restive about a renew u s occupation of iraq american airstrikes have be criticise a a drizzle when what be require resemble a cloud burst in a thunder storm so far there have be an average of five strike a day compare with in libya in in afghanistan and a day in iraq itself during the u lead invasion so far only of the sortie over iraq and syria have actually involve drop bomb or fire missile until these raid at the weekend there have be an absence of actionable intelligence from the grind while pentagon lawyer be be ultra cautious about avoid any civilian casualty the long distance plan have to fly from base in qatar or the uae or from carrier in the persian gulf also make it hard for them to loiter look for target of opportunity so while it would be a significant blow to isi to lose it self style caliph he be replaceable in what in practice be a collective leadership with many experience and harden personality and he may yet rise from the dead

2540,be your breakfast omelet harm your heart a recent study by researcher at western university in canada find that the more egg yolk people eat the thicker their artery wall become an indicator of heart disease risk and that the effect be almost a bad a from smoke cigarette in the study the researcher measure carotid plaque build up in the artery of men and woman average age who be seek care at cardiovascular health clinic participant fill out questionnaire detail lifestyle habit include medication use cigarette smoke and egg yolk consumption the researcher gauge how much people smoke and how many egg yolk they eat over time by calculate their pack year the number of pack of cigarette people smoke per day multiply by the number of year they spend smoke and egg yolk year how many egg yolk they eat per week for how many year after about age participant plaque begin build up steadily but among the participant who eat the most egg three or more yolk per week that build up increase exponentially the study find a people s egg yolk year go up so do their plaque accumulation an association that be independent of factor like gender cholesterol level blood pressure smoke body mass index and diabetes more good news kid cholesterol level be down among the of participant who eat the most egg the carotid plaque build up be about two third that of the study s heaviest smoker the researcher conclude that the plaque increase from eat egg follow a similar pattern to that of cigarette smoke arterial accumulation of plaque be a key risk factor for heart attack and stroke a plaque build up it thicken artery wall and narrow the space through which blood can flow force the heart to pump harder if plaque become unstable they can break off and form clot which can halt blood flow to either the brain or the heart cause stroke or heart attack the author argue that their find should quell doubt over the link between high dietary cholesterol and heart disease the prevail tendency to ignore dietary cholesterol a a risk factor for coronary heart disease require reassessment include the consumption of cholesterol from egg the author write the government s dietary guideline recommend that adult consume no more than mg of cholesterol a day one whole egg contain about mg of cholesterol nearly two third of your daily recommend ma the mantra egg can be part of a healthy diet for healthy people have confuse the issue it have be know for a long time that a high cholesterol intake increase the risk of cardiovascular event and egg yolk have a very high cholesterol content study author dr david spence a professor of neurology at western s schulich school of medicine dentistry say in a statement in diabetic an egg a day increase coronary risk by two to five fold the study be publish in the journal atherosclerosis
2541,problem last year the average american consume egg over percent more than the world per caput average because egg yolk be high in cholesterol eat whole egg increase cholesterol a know risk factor for coronary artery disease cad and heart attack previous research also link cad with cigarette smoke methodology canadian researcher examine patient at london's health science centre's university hospital the average age of all the patient be ultrasound measurement of the carotid artery establish the presence and quantity of atherosclerotic plaque and the scan be accompany by lifestyle survey smoke be measure in pack year number of pack per day multiply by the number of year spend smoke egg yolk consumption be measure in egg yolk year result age be associate with a linear increase in arterial plaque after age but smoke and egg consumption be each independently associate with an exponential increase in plaque egg consumption have two third of the effect of smoke conclusion egg yolk be almost a bad for your carotid artery a smoke implication while the link between egg and cholesterol and between cholesterol and heart disease be well establish this study shed light on the extent of their potential harm if eat routinely in large quantity a single large egg contain more than mg of cholesterol more than a third of a person's daily recommend intake by this measure a typical american breakfast alone with two egg plus bacon would push well past that egg white meanwhile remain excellent source the full study egg yolk consumption and carotid plaque be publish in the journal atherosclerosis
2542,remember the s when doctor equate egg with cholesterol and heart disease a recent canadian study involve over adult publish in the peer review journal atherosclerosis say that eat egg yolk be about a bad a smoke cigarette when it come to advance coronary heart disease we re already see crack in the theory in the study researcher record the number of egg eat and pack of cigarette smoke a recall by each adult average age everyone in the study have be refer to a vascular prevention clinic at a canadian hospital mean their heart health and the habit that lead them there be already in question the researcher find that a expect plaque build up in their subject carotid artery thicken with age and even correlate with smoke and egg eat habit publication like the daily mail and fox news have report blindly on the matter but thankfully there be others out there suspiciously raise eyebrow the uk s national health service point out some of the study s limitation include the accuracy of the participant recollection of egg yolk consumption a lack of detail regard how the egg be cook or not disregard for other factor of heart disease advancement include but not limit to exercise alcohol consumption antidepressant use antidepressant have be show to cause artery to thicken faster than age and other important dietary factor neither the study in question nor the nh take into consideration however the harmful effect of the chemical and hormone find in non organic egg the effect on the human body from eat egg from chicken give gmo fee the live condition of the chicken non organic egg can contain the same antibiotic chemical and hormone administer to conventional chicken add gmo fee pollute water and unsanitary live condition to these chicken and you may have egg that be little more than hard shell pellet of poison organic egg from healthy chicken on gmo free fee have actually show in many study to prevent heart disease they contain healthful amount of protein vitamin b omega fatty acid and many nutrient like lutein and zeaxanthin which reduce risk for age relate macular degeneration amd a major cause of blindness the key moderation a with most thing and buy organic egg from local farmer who can raise their chicken in truly cage free condition happy healthy chicken produce more healthful egg
2543,conventional medical authority say that consumption of saturate animal fat be bad for you and cause heart disease but a hundred year ago fewer than than one in one hundred american be obese and coronary heart disease be unknown the procter and gamble start market crisco a a new kind of food the first commercially market trans fat crisco be originally use to make candle and soap but with electrification cause a decline in candle sale procter and gamble decide to promote the fat a a healthier all vegetable derive shorten accord to lewrockwell com feed high dose of fat and cholesterol to omnivore like rat and dog do not produce atherosclerotic lesion in them in fact it turn out that people who have highest percentage of saturate fat in their diet have the lowest risk of heart disease the last word on this subject should go to julia child enjoy eat saturate fat they re good for you dr mercola's comment the demonization of saturate fat begin in when dr ancel key publish a paper compare saturate fat intake and heart disease mortality his theory turn out to be flimsy to say the least but the misguide oust of saturate fat have continue unabated ever since fortunately the truth be finally start to come out a medical scientist have begin to seriously question keys' find time to put ancel keys' theory to rest key base his theory on a study of six country in which higher saturate fat intake equate to higher rat of heart disease however he conveniently ignore data from other country that do not fit his theory have he choose a different set of country the data would have show that increase the percent of calorie from fat reduce the number of death from coronary heart disease and a illustrate in the feature article when you include all country for which data be available at the time of his study you find that those who consume the highest percentage of saturate fat have the lowest risk of heart disease furthermore many have now realize that it's the trans fat find in margarine vegetable shorten and partially hydrogenate vegetable oil that be the true villain cause far more significant health problem than saturate fat ever could still despite the scientific evidence the low fat dogma remain a favorite among most government health authority case in point the most recent food chart issue by the u s department of agriculture usda in december of last year recommend reduce your saturate fat intake to a mere seven percent of caloric intake down from it previously recommend percent newer study debunk keys' theory the usda's lower recommendation be illogical when you consider the evidence available today which support saturate fat a a necessary part of a heart healthy diet for example a discus in the feature article a number of indigenous tribe around the world be live proof that a high saturate fat diet equate to low mortality from heart disease these include tribe primary diet percentage saturate fat maasai tribe in kenya tanzania meat milk cattle blood percent inuit eskimo in the arctic whale meat and blubber percent rendille tribe in ne kenya camel milk meat blood percent tokealu atoll island in new zealand territory fish and coconut percent and then there's human breast milk which contain percent saturate fat since breast milk be the most perfect diet in existence for develop infant the presence of high amount of saturate fat cannot easily be construe a a mistake furthermore a meta analysis publish last year which pool data from study and include nearly adult find no difference in the risk of heart disease and stroke between people with the lowest and highest intake of saturate fat in a editorial publish in the archive of internal medicine dr william castelli a former director of the framingham heart study state in framingham mass the more saturate fat one eat the more cholesterol one eat the more calorie one eat the lower the person's serum cholesterol the opposite of what key et al would predict we find that the people who eat the most cholesterol eat the most saturate fat eat the most calorie weigh the least and be the most physically active another study publish in the american journal of clinical nutrition find that a reduction in saturate fat intake must be evaluate in the context of replacement by other macronutrients such a carbohydrate when you replace saturate fat with a higher carbohydrate intake particularly refine carbohydrate you exacerbate insulin resistance and obesity increase triglyceride and small ldl particle and reduce beneficial hdl cholesterol the author state that dietary effort to improve your cardiovascular disease risk should primarily emphasize the limitation of refine carbohydrate intake and weight reduction i believe that last point be very important and be likely a major key for explain the rampant increase in obesity heart disease and diabetes and once you can pinpoint the problem turn it all around become that much easier carbohydrate not fat be the root of obesity and heart disease heart disease be so common today it's hard for people to remember that a mere year ago this disease be really uncommon a dr donald miller write in the feature article there be cardiologist practice in the u s in there be of them now a fold increase for a population that have only double since such an explosion of heart disease indicate that something have change that be contribute to this epidemic what be that something our diet most likely the study that have link the so call western diet to an increase heart disease risk simply confirm that sugar and refine carbohydrate be harmful to your heart health because although the western diet be high in red and process meat and saturate fat it's also alarmingly high in sugar and refine carbs like bread and pasta and a conclude in the last study list above when you reduce saturate fat and increase refine carbohydrate you end up promote obesity heart disease and diabetes gary taubes have also do an excellent job of explain the connection between carbs and obesity and it relate health issue in his book why we get fat and what to do about it in a nutshell eat fat and protein do not make you fat carbohydrate do i firmly believe the two primary key for successful weight management and reduce your risk for diabetes heart disease and other weight relate health problem be severely restrict carbohydrate sugar fructose and grain in your diet and increase healthy fat consumption accord to last year's report of the dietary guideline advisory committee on the dietary guideline for american the top source of calorie in the american diet be grain base dessert cake cooky donut pie crisp cobbler and granola bar calorie a day alcoholic beverage yeast bread calorie a day pasta and pasta dish chicken and chicken mix dish calorie a day mexican mix dish soda energy drink and sport drink calorie a day beef and beef mix dish pizza calorie a day dairy dessert look at this list it plain to see that carbs i e sugar primarily fructose and grain be the primary source of our weight and health problem not saturate fat a an update you've often hear me state that soda be the number one source of calorie in the u diet which it be base on the national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes the update nhanes survey above cover nutritional data from place grain base food in the top two slot still soda come in at number four and i still believe a lot of people particularly teenager probably get a majority of their calorie from fructose rich drink like soda the different type of fat fat can be confuse but you can generally divide fat into four type saturate fat from animal fat and tropical oil monounsaturated fat such a olive oil polyunsaturated fat such a omega and omega fat trans fat such a margarine source of healthy fat include olive and olive oil coconut and coconut oil butter make from raw grass feed organic milk raw nut such a almond or pecan organic pasture egg yolk avocado grass feed meat palm oil unheated organic nut oil another healthful fat you want to be mindful of be animal base omega deficiency in this essential fat can cause or contribute to very serious health problem both mental and physical and may be a significant underlie factor of up to premature death each year for more information about omega 's and the best source of this fat please review this previous article have the proper balance between omega and omega fat be also very important for optimal health so in addition to increase your omega which most people be sorely deficient in you also want to decrease your consumption of omega find primarily in corn oil soy oil canola oil safflower oil sunflower oil the ideal ratio of omega to omega be but the typical american diet be more like in favor of omega the overabundance of these oil in process food of all kind explain our excess omega level the other fat you want to avoid be the trans fat trans fat be form when hydrogen be add to vegetable oil during food process in order to make it solidify this process know a hydrogenation make fat le likely to spoil so food stay fresh longer have a longer shelf life and also have a le greasy feel the end result of the hydrogenation process be a completely unnatural fat that cause dysfunction and chaos in your body on a cellular level your body need saturate fat for optimal function saturate fat from animal and vegetable source provide a number of important health benefit in fact your body cannot function without saturate fat saturate fat be need for the proper function of your cell membrane heart bone to assimilate calcium liver lung hormone immune system satiety reduce hunger genetic regulation healthy fat tip to live by so please remember you do need a certain amount of healthy fat while at the same time you'll want to avoid the unhealthy variety the easiest way to accomplish this be to simply eliminate process food which be high in all thing detrimental to your health sugar carbs and dangerous type of fat after that these tip can help ensure you're eat the right fat for your health use organic butter make from raw grass feed milk instead of margarine and vegetable oil spread butter be a healthy whole food that have receive an unwarranted bad rap use coconut oil for cook it be far superior to any other cook oil and be load with health benefit remember that olive oil should be use cold drizzle over salad or fish for example not to cook with follow my nutrition plan will automatically reduce your modify fat intake a it will teach you to focus on healthy whole food instead of process junk food to round out your healthy fat intake be sure to eat raw fat such a those from avocado raw dairy product and olive oil and also take a high quality source of animal base omega fat such a krill oil
2544,we ve be tell that saturate fat be unhealthy it be claim to raise cholesterol level and give u heart attack however many recent study suggest that the true picture be more complicate than that this article take a detail look at saturate fat and whether it be good or bad for your health what be saturate fat fat be macronutrients that be nutrient that we consume in large amount and give u energy each fat molecule be make of one glycerol molecule and three fatty acid which can be either saturate monounsaturated or polyunsaturated what this saturation stuff have to do with be the number of double bond in the molecule saturate fatty acid have no double bond monounsaturated fatty acid have one double bond and polyunsaturated fatty acid have two or more double bond this picture here show the difference saturate v unsaturated fatty acidsphoto source another way to phrase this be that saturate fatty acid have all their carbon c atom fully saturate with hydrogen h atom food that be high in saturate fat include fatty meat lard full fat dairy product like butter and cream coconut coconut oil palm oil and dark chocolate actually fat contain a combination of different fatty acid no fat be pure saturate fat or pure mono or polyunsaturated even food like beef also contain a significant amount of mono and polyunsaturated fat fat that be mostly saturate like butter tend to be solid at room temperature while fat that be mostly unsaturated like olive oil be liquid at room temperature like other fat saturate fat contain calorie per gram bottom line saturate fat be fat that contain a high proportion of saturate fatty acid which contain no double bond saturate fat be solid at room temperature why do people think that it be harmful a single butter curl back in the th century there be a major epidemic of heart disease run rampant in america it use to be a rare disease but very quickly it skyrocket and become the number one cause of death which it still be researcher learn that eat saturate fat seem to increase level of cholesterol in the bloodstream this be an important find at the time because they also know that have high cholesterol be link to an increase risk of heart disease this lead to the follow assumption be make if saturate fat raise cholesterol a cause b and cholesterol cause heart disease b cause c then this must mean that saturate fat cause heart disease a cause c however at the time this be not base on any experimental evidence in human this hypothesis call the diet heart hypothesis be base on assumption observational data and animal study the diet heart hypothesis then turn into public policy in before it be ever prove to be true even though we now have plenty of experimental data in human show these initial assumption to be wrong people be still be tell to avoid saturate fat in order to reduce heart disease risk bottom line saturate fat have be assume to cause heart disease by raise cholesterol in the blood however no experimental evidence have ever directly link saturate fat to heart disease saturate fat can raise ldl the bad cholesterol but also hdl the good cholesterol it s important to realize that the word cholesterol be often use inaccurately older male doctor hdl and ldl the good and bad cholesterol aren t actually cholesterol they be protein that carry cholesterol around know a lipoprotein ldl stand for low density lipoprotein and hdl stand for high density lipoprotein all cholesterol be identical at first scientist only measure total cholesterol which include cholesterol within both ldl and hdl later they learn that while ldl be link to increase risk hdl be link to reduce risk total cholesterol be actually a highly flaw marker because it also include hdl so have a high hdl protective actually contribute to a high total cholesterol because saturate fat raise ldl level it seem logical to assume that this would increase the risk of heart disease but scientist mostly ignore the fact that saturate fat also raise hdl all that be say new research have show that ldl isn t necessarily bad because there be different subtypes of ldl small dense ldl these be small lipoprotein that can penetrate the arterial wall easily which drive heart disease large ldl these lipoprotein be large and fluffy and don t easily penetrate the artery the small dense particle be also much more susceptible to become oxidize which be a crucial step in the heart disease process people with mostly small ldl particle have three time greater risk of heart disease compare to those with mostly large ldl particle so if we want to reduce our risk of heart disease we want to have mostly large ldl particle and a little of the small one a possible here s an interest bite of information that be often ignore by mainstream nutritionist eat saturate fat change the ldl particle from small dense to large what this imply be that even though saturate fat can mildly raise ldl they be change the ldl to a benign subtype that be associate with a reduce risk of heart disease even the effect of saturate fat on ldl aren t a dramatic a you may think although they increase ldl in the short term plenty of long term observational study find no link between saturate fat consumption and ldl level it also seem to depend on the chain length of the fatty acid for example palmitic acid carbon may raise ldl while stearic acid carbon do not now scientist have realize that it s not just about the ldl concentration or the size of the particle but the number of ldl particle call ldl p float in the bloodstream low carb diet which tend to be high in saturate fat can lower ldl p while low fat diet can have an adverse effect and raise ldl p bottom line saturate fat raise hdl the good cholesterol and change ldl from small dense bad to large ldl which be mostly benign overall saturate fat do not harm the blood lipid profile like previously believe do saturate fat cause heart disease old man take pill the supposedly harmful effect of saturate fat be the cornerstone of modern dietary guideline because of that this topic have receive enormous amount of fund however despite decade of research and billion of dollar spend scientist still haven t be able to demonstrate a clear link several recent review study that combine data from multiple other study find that there really be no link between saturate fat consumption and heart disease this include a review of study with a total of participant publish in their conclusion there be absolutely no association between saturate fat and heart disease another review publish in look at data from study both observational study and control trial with a total of participant they find no link between saturate fat and heart disease we also have a systematic review from the cochrane collaboration which combine data from numerous randomize control trial accord to their review publish in reduce saturate fat have no effect on death or death from heart disease however they find that replace saturate fat with unsaturated fat reduce the risk of cardiac event but not death by this do not imply that saturate fat be bad just that certain type of unsaturated fat mostly omega s be protective while saturate fat be neutral so the biggest and best study on saturate fat and heart disease show that there be no direct link it be a myth all along unfortunately the government and mainstream health organization seem reluctant to change their mind and continue to promote the old low fat dogma for more read this review of recent study on saturate fat and health bottom line the link between saturate fat and heart disease have be study intensely for decade but the biggest and best study show that there be no statistically significant association do a diet low in saturate fat have any health benefit or help you live longer frustrate young woman with vegetable on a plate several massive study have be conduct on the low fat diet this be the diet recommend by the usda and mainstream health organization all over the world the main purpose of this diet be to reduce the intake of saturate fat and cholesterol this diet also recommend increase consumption of fruit vegetable and whole grain along with reduce consumption of sugar the woman s health initiative be the biggest nutrition study in history it be a randomize control trial with woman who be instruct to eat a low fat diet after year there be only kg pound difference in weight and there be zero difference in heart disease cancer or death other massive study have confirm this the low fat diet provide no benefit for heart disease or the risk of death several study that replace saturate fat with polyunsaturated vegetable oil show that more people in the vegetable oil group end up die it be interest to see that since the low fat guideline come out the prevalence of obesity have skyrocket low fat guideline and obesity epidemic this graph show that the obesity epidemic start full force at the same time the low fat advice be peak the type diabetes epidemic follow soon after of course this graph alone doesn t prove anything correlation do not equal causation but it do make sense that replace traditional food like butter and meat with process low fat food high in sugar have something to do with it it s also interest when look at the literature that in almost every single study compare the expert approve low fat diet to other diet include paleo vegan low carb and mediterranean it lose bottom line study on the low fat diet do not show a reduce risk of heart disease or death and some study show that replace saturate fat with vegetable oil increase the risk people with certain medical condition may want to minimize saturate fat suspicious doctor the result of most study be base on average the study clearly show that on average saturate fat do not raise the risk of heart disease however within those average there be room for individual variability perhaps most individual see no effect while others experience decrease risk and yet others experience an increase risk that be say there be definitely some people who may want to minimize saturate fat in the diet this include individual with a genetic disorder call familial hypercholesterolemia a well a people who have a gene variant call apoe with time the science of genetics will most surely discover more way in which diet affect our individual risk for disease bottom line some people may want to minimize saturate fat intake include people with familial hypercholesterolemia or a gene call apoe saturate fat be excellent for cook and food that be high in it tend to be healthy and nutritious saturate fat have some important beneficial aspect that be rarely mention chef hold bell pepper and meat for example saturate fat be excellent for cook because they have no double bond they be highly resistant to heat induce damage polyunsaturated fat on the other hand easily oxidize when they re heat for this reason coconut oil lard and butter be all excellent choice for cook especially for high heat cook method like fry food that be naturally high in saturate fat also tend to be healthy and nutritious a long a you re eat quality unprocessed food these include naturally feed raise meat dairy product from grass feed cow dark chocolate and coconut bottom line saturate fat be excellent cook fat and food that be high in saturate fat tend to be both healthy and nutritious the bad fat you should avoid like the plague bottle of vegetable oil there be many different type of fat some of them be good for u others neutral yet others be clearly harmful the evidence point to saturate and monounsaturated fat be perfectly safe and maybe even downright healthy however the situation be a bite more complicate with polyunsaturated fat when it come to those we have both omega s and omega s we need to get these two type of fatty acid in a certain balance but most people be eat way too many omega fatty acid these day it be a good idea to eat plenty of omega s such a from fatty fish but most people would do best by reduce their omega consumption the best way to do that be to avoid seed and vegetable oil like soybean and corn oil a well a the process food that contain them another class of fat artificial trans fat be also very harmful trans fat be make by expose polyunsaturated vegetable oil to a chemical process that involve high heat hydrogen gas and a metal catalyst study show that trans fat lead to insulin resistance inflammation belly fat accumulation and drastically raise the risk of heart disease so eat your saturate fat monounsaturated fat and omega s but avoid trans fat and process vegetable oil like the plague bottom line the truly harmful fat be artificial trans fat and process vegetable oil high in omega fatty acid blame new health problem on old food doesn t make sense the health authority have spend an immense amount of resource study the link between saturate fat and heart disease despite thousand of scientist decade of work and billion of dollar spend this hypothesis still hasn t be support by any good evidence the saturate fat myth wasn t prove in the past isn t prove today and never will be prove because it s just flat out wrong not only be this myth not support by scientific evidence it be easily refute with some plain common sense human and pre human have be eat saturate fat for hundred of thousand if not million of year but the heart disease epidemic start a hundred year ago blame new health problem on old food just doesn t make sense
2545,saturate fat have long be call ''bad fats'' for their effect on the heart but a new analysis call into question whether they're really that bad after all the find publish in the annals of internal medicine have spark renew debate about fat and heart health the new study should trigger a review of current diet guideline for heart health accord to the researcher who do the analysis other expert include one from the american heart association disagree there be some common grind all agree that dietary fat be just one factor that drive heart disease risk pay attention to the other factor be also important webmd ask a study co author a cardiologist a nutrition expert and the american heart association to elaborate what do the analysis look at and find researcher look at publish study on fat and heart disease the study involve more than people from country some people already have heart disease while others do not the researcher reanalyzed the result an approach call a meta analysis they look at whether different fat help or hurt your heart the different fat include saturate fat find in meat whole fat dairy product and bake good polyunsaturated fat such a omega and omega find in fish nut seed and vegetable oil monounsaturated fat find in olive and canola oil trans fat find in fry food and bake good and be phase out of the food supply the surprise saturate fat long think to raise heart disease risk have no effect neither do monounsaturated fat which be think to help the heart say study researcher dariush mozaffarian md at the harvard school of public health which fat do have an effect trans fat know to raise bad cholesterol and lower good cholesterol be link with a higher risk of heart disease a expect omega s from food help omega s appear to help what do the researcher say about the find nutritional guideline on fat and heart health by such organization a the american heart association may deserve another look the study author say the focus should move beyond just the fat content of food mozaffarian say we can't judge the healthfulness of a food only by how many gram of saturate fat it have we really should be move toward a food base analysis it's not just the fat gram and the type of food but the way the food be process he say for instance the analysis find that a type of saturate fat link with milk and dairy product reduce heart disease risk base on the analysis mozaffarian and his colleague say the current heart health guideline that promote eat more food with omega s and omega s and le of those with saturate fat be not need what do others say other expert find fault with the study and it conclusion mainly i think the find should be disregard say walter willett md chair of nutrition at the harvard school of public health who be not involve in the study while the analysis suggest that ''saturated fat be not quite a bad a it reputation it depend on what you compare it to he say if you replace saturate fat with carbohydrate or refine starch or sugar you be not change your heart disease risk he say ''if you replace saturate fat with polyunsaturated fat you do get a reduction in heart disease risk one analysis be not enough to change dietary advice say jam blankenship md director of cardiology at geisinger medical center in the analysis the researcher themselves cite a number of caveat and limitation such a study participant self report their fat intake in response to the study the american heart association say it guideline remain the same for heart health it recommend a diet rich in fruit and vegetable whole grain fish nut and unsaturated fat le than of the diet should include saturate and trans fat the association say be there some common grind about how to protect heart health yes judge how heart healthy a food be must take more than fat into account mozaffarian say for instance a lower fat meat that be process be not heart healthy he say willett agree it's important to look at single nutrient but also at whole food group he say blankenship offer these step prove to benefit the heart get regular exercise at least a half hour a day maintain a healthy body weight see your doctor and find out your heart disease risk know your blood pressure and cholesterol level don't spend so much time look at food label blankenship say instead he say go to the grocery store's produce department and load up if cholesterol and saturate fat don't play a large a role a we think in heart disease what's behind the heart disease problem multiple factor blankenship say they include obesity genetics sedentary lifestyle diabetes and high blood pressure a poor diet drive risk he say but it's not the only thing mozaffarian report receive fee from bunge pollock institute quaker oat life science research organization foodminds nutrition impact amarin astra zeneca winston and strawn llp and uptodate and serve on the scientific advisory board for unilever north america the study be fund by the british

2546,poor old saturate fat for over forty year now it s be speak of only in hush tone dis a nothing but artery clog obesity cause poison this common sense fact have become so widely accept that a lot of people who want to improve their diet start by purchase skim milk ditch their egg yolk and begin a life free of steak pork and butter it s time to bring bacon back to breakfast after all saturate fat be good for you we ve make a huge mistake but we all make mistake this one start in with the first publication of the seven country study the research look at the incidence of saturate fat intake and heart disease among men from you guess it seven different country and show a correlation between the two unfortunately the study be deeply flaw it didn t take into account important factor like smoke rat sugar consumption and exercise level and it leave out an awful lot of data from other country that contradict the conclusion the study s author actually have access to twenty two country data and didn t discus any of the population that follow diet with plenty of saturate fat and barely experience any heart disease such community include the kenyan masai the tokelau in polynesia and the arctic inuit government follow by make the suppose saturate fat heart disease connection a matter of public health policy an ideology which probably culminate with the abominable food pyramid of the s which recommend up to serve of rice and pasta per day and about a little fat a possible the result in the past year in the unite state the amount of calorie from consume fat have fall from percent to percent while obesity have double and heart disease have remain the country s number one killer but the spread of obesity have no single cause there be a lot of complicate factor that have lead to america s health crisis to figure out whether saturate fat should be add back into our diet let s take a closer look at it effect on the body why saturate fat doesn't cause heart disease in a evaluation of study and subject saturate fat be not associate with an increase risk of coronary heart disease and numerous other study have reach similar conclusion of course these study aren t without controversy for instance greatist expert and physician dr jam hardeman believe those study aren t comprehensive enough on average their subject be study for around year which may not be long enough to see the effect of a diet high in saturate fat however they raise important question about saturate fat s effect on the artery of the heart and brain pin it but what about cholesterol we actually have two kind of cholesterol in our blood the hdl good and ldl bad total cholesterol level be le important than the ratio of hdl to ldl but a simpler if kind of flaw approach be that we should try to increase hdl and decrease ldl saturate fat be generally believe to increase the bad cholesterol but that s only part of the story because there be also two kind of ldl cholesterol big floaty particle type a and small dense one type b when someone reduce their consumption of saturate fat and their ldl cholesterol drop they re only lower their type a particle but it s the type b particle that be more closely link in heart disease and they re generally control by carbohydrate consumption so the best way to cut out harmful type of cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease could be to follow a diet that s low in carbs rather than fat why saturate fat can be good for you saturate fat have be show to have load of positive effect on the body include liver health saturate fat encourage the liver cell to dump their fat cell which help the liver to function more effectively immunity saturate fatty acid especially the kind find in butter and coconut help white blood cell to recognize and destroy invade virus and bacteria go get em boy hormone eat saturate fat tend to increase free testosterone level which help to repair tissue preserve muscle and improve sexual function now fat be high in calorie so it can promote weight gain in that respect per gram it have more than twice the calorie of protein or carbohydrate but provide an eye be keep on portion size saturate fat in and of itself doesn t have any negative impact on the body in fact increase fat intake might help with weight loss one study find that when three group of obese people be feed diet of percent fat percent protein and percent carbohydrate respectively the high fat group lose the most weight plus it taste freak delicious drop that hot dog this doesn t mean every source of saturate fat be healthy case in point a study from the harvard school of public health find that after analyze the diet of million people there be no association between eat red meat and heart disease but there be for those who eat a lot of process meat that be to say if we re go to get sick from eat meat or saturate fat it ll be by get it from a crappy source basically we should spend a little more on food the body love saturate fat but from source like grass feed meat and butter whole egg and coconut fat not hot dog and pepperoni pizza sorry by a mile the biggest enemy in our food be likely refine sugar even the american heart association which be still anti saturate fat agree that sugar be a far bigger contributor to heart disease but the tide be very slowly start to turn prominent journal and scientist be begin to speak out on saturate fat s benefit and after government scientist review study on diet and obesity sweden recently become the first western country to advocate a high fat diet to it citizen that s because heart disease and obesity be cause by inactivity trans fat refine carbs and overeat to name a few but not saturate fat toss the margarine and tuck into some butter vegetable or a sear steak we think you deserve it
2547,saturate fat have be a controversial subject in recent year with some research suggest that it may not be a bad for health a once think but a new study publish in the bmj dash any hope that butter be actually back cut down on saturate fatty acid find in animal food like dairy and meat a well a palm and coconut oil may lower risk of coronary heart disease accord to researcher and swap these food for unsaturated fat from vegetable oil nut seed avocado and seafood for example whole grain and plant base protein think lentil and edamame seem to boost heart health even further the new find be significant because saturate fat have be a source of debate study have show that saturate fatty acid can affect cholesterol but there's hasn't be any definitive research link them to overall heart health a large meta analysis publish this summer for example find that butter consumption do not appear to raise heart disease risk the current u s dietary guideline have take a conservative approach to saturate fat say they should make up no more than of total calorie qi sun md assistant professor of nutrition in the harvard t h chan school of public health and senior author of the new study say his group s find back up this advice relate healthy high fat food you should eat the new study also bolster government recommendation for eat an overall healthful diet dr sun tell health one that include fruit vegetable whole grain vegetable cook oil rich in polyunsaturated fat and monounsaturated fat the two main type of unsaturated fat nut legume fish and low fat dairy to determine saturate fat s long term effect on heart health he and his colleague follow more than woman and men for an average of year collect data on their diet and health every four year after control for factor such a age ethnicity and other potential influencers the researcher find that participant who consume the most calorie from four commonly consume saturate fatty acid lauric acid myristic acid plametic acid and stearic acid be more likely to develop coronary heart disease over the course of the study than those who consume the least some researcher have suggest put individual limit on each of these fatty acid say co author frank hu phd professor of nutrition and epidemiology in a press release but that s not practical he argue since they share many of the same food source red meat dairy fat butter lard and palm oil relate good fat bat fat how to choose instead it be healthier to focus on lower total saturate fat intake say hu in fact the researcher estimate that replace just of those fat with the same number of calorie from poly or monounsaturated fat think avocado and nut whole grain or plant base protein could reduce heart disease risk by to the study specifically recommend swap animal fat butter and lard with vegetable oil high in unsaturated fat and point out that restaurant food and snack and bakery item include cracker chip popcorn cake and cooky can be high in saturate fat the researcher also offer some insight a to why prior study haven't always show a clear link between le saturate fat intake and better heart health often the author say people who cut back on saturate fat replace those calorie with low quality carbs like process food and refine flour these be associate with health risk of their own and likely cancel out any health benefit relate the worst food for trans fat this be the largest observational study to date to examine the association between specific saturate fatty acid and the risk of coronary heart disease say the author and it result be in line with previous research that have focus specifically on healthy swap while the find aren t terribly surprise they do serve one important purpose a hu put it this study dispel the notion that butter be back '

2551,many people with chronic health problem resign themselves to live of modest activity or no activity at all think vigorous exercise be unsafe or that they lack the stamen for it but recent study be prove just the opposite they be show that high intensity exercise may be even better than regular aerobic activity for many patient with condition like heart disease diabetes stroke pulmonary disease arthritis and parkinson s disease the study strongly suggest that a more demand but more efficient and often more enjoyable form of exercise know a high intensity interval train or hiit be not only safe for most patient but more effective at prevent or reverse the deficit associate with many chronic ailment although once reserve for athlete seek a competitive advantage and for healthy people want to burn more body fat hiit be now be study a a treatment that be sometimes a effective a medication for many people with chronic health problem researcher have find that repeatedly push the body close to it exercise limit for very brief period intersperse with period of rest be more effective than continuous moderate activity at improve cardiovascular respiratory metabolic and mechanical function instead of continuous movement for or more minute a be typical for exercise walker jogger and cyclist hiit usually involve to second of exercise near the peak of a person s ability follow by a comparable recovery period of easy activity with the sequence repeat for a total of about minute three time a week we know that exercise be good for people at risk of chronic disease but people tend not to exercise say jonathan p little a specialist in exercise physiology at the university of british columbia at okanagan yet he and other researcher report that study participant find interval train more enjoyable than continuous aerobic exercise make it more likely that people will continue it on their own various activity can be adapt to interval train include cycle swim walk and jog especially on a machine like a stationary bike or treadmill but hiit be possible indoors and out for example by alternate sprint with more moderate exercise the intensity be tailor to an individual s start ability the high intensity component be set at to percent of the person s maximum aerobic capacity dr little say researcher commonly use exercise bike and treadmill to adjust the pace mechanically however high intensity exercise even just half a minute at a time be not appropriate for everyone in a recent report in the american college of sport medicine s health fitness journal dr little his wife mary e jung also at the university of british columbia and marcus w kilpatrick of the university of south florida write that hiit be only appropriate for low risk individual moderate risk individual who have be clear for vigorous intensity by a medical professional and high risk individual who be under direct medical supervision during exercise train among the physiological benefit of hiit be the body s increase ability to use oxygen and insulin a well a artery that be more elastic than continuous moderate exercise can achieve we ve see for example that interval train be remarkably effective at lower glucose level in people with diabetes dr little say in an interview just one session improve a person s glucose level a week control study in denmark of high intensity interval walk for patient with type diabetes show it help control blood glucose level better than continuous moderate exercise even though the same number of calorie be expend by both group interval train also be more effective at enhance the patient physical fitness and reduce body fat relative to lean muscle tissue by make blood vessel better able to expand hiit can improve the cardiovascular system s ability to respond to add exertion oxygen carry blood can flow more smoothly through artery that be wide open which also reduce the risk of a vessel block clot the body s ability to use oxygen efficiently improve markedly after a little a two week of train with hiit the researcher write peak oxygen uptake the amount of oxygen an individual can use during intense exercise be consider the best indicator of cardiovascular fitness and an independent predictor of illness and death in cardiac patient too many people think incorrectly that high intensity exercise be only for athlete that it s a heart attack wait to happen dr little say on the contrary the research strongly suggest it be more likely to reduce the risk of a heart attack in a report review the effect of hiit in patient with coronary artery disease and heart failure researcher in canada france and switzerland write that hiit appear safe and better tolerate by patient than moderate intensity continuous exercise and more effective at increase patient peak oxygen uptake blood vessel flexibility and pump ability of the heart patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease be often unable to exercise long enough to gain need health benefit but they can do hiit for long period with le shortness of breath and leg discomfort researcher at the national and kapodistrian university of athens have report stroke patient with persistent disability can also benefit from hiit a rehabilitation specialist at the university of cincinnati write this month in bioportfolio stroke patient with residual weakness enter a vicious cycle of limit activity and deconditioning but while regular aerobic exercise can improve their function and cardiovascular health preliminary study include one in trondheim norway suggest that patient do even better with hiit the norwegian team report that the improvement persist for month after the six week high intensity exercise program end and polish researcher demonstrate that hiit could alleviate the rigidity and excessive muscle tone that make it difficult for parkinson s disease patient to move their arm and leg the researcher from the university school of physical education in krakow poland show in patient with mild to moderate parkinson s symptom that eight week of hiit three time a week on a stationary bike have a global benefit improve both lower and upper body function reduction in rigidity and stiffness correlate with an increase in a substance call brain derive neurotrophic factor which the researcher suggest could have

that kushner son in law and confidant to then president elect trump make the proposal during a meet on dec or at trump tower accord to intercept of russian communication that be review by u s official kislyak say kushner suggest use russian diplomatic facility in the unite state for the communication the meet also be attend by michael flynn trump s first national security adviser the white house disclose the meet only in march play down it significance but people familiar with the matter say the fbi now consider the encounter a well a another meet kushner have with a russian banker to be of investigative interest kislyak reportedly be take aback by the suggestion of allow an american to use russian communication gear at it embassy or consulate a proposal that would have carry security risk for moscow a well a the trump team neither the meet nor the communication of american involve be under u s surveillance official say the white house decline to comment robert kelner a lawyer for flynn decline to comment the russian embassy do not respond to request for comment russia at time feed false information into communication stream it suspect be monitor a a way of sow misinformation and confusion among u s analyst but official say that it s unclear what kislyak would have have to gain by falsely characterize his contact with kushner to moscow particularly at a time when the kremlin still saw the prospect of dramatically improve relation with trump kushner s apparent interest in establish a secret channel with moscow rather than rely on u s government system have add to the intrigue surround the trump administration s relationship with russia the fbi closely monitor the communication of russian official in the unite state and it maintain a nearly constant surveillance of it diplomatic facility the national security agency monitor the communication of russian official overseas current and former u s intelligence official say that although russian diplomat have secure mean of communicate with moscow kushner s apparent request for access to such channel be extraordinary how would he trust that the russian wouldn t leak it on their side say one former senior intelligence official the fbi would know that a trump transition official be go in and out of the embassy which would cause a great deal of concern he add the entire idea he say seem extremely naive or absolutely crazy the discussion of a secret channel add to a broader pattern of effort by trump s closest adviser to obscure their contact with russian counterpart trump s first

emirate the obama white house only learn that the crown prince of abu dhabi be fly to new york in december to see kushner flynn and stephen k bannon another top trump adviser because u s border agent in the uae spot the emirate leader s name on a flight manifest russia would also have have reason of it own to reject such an overture from kushner do so would require moscow to expose it most

2565,the white house say that president trump fire jam comey on tuesday because he receive a brief letter from attorney general jeff session call for the fbi director s dismissal that letter rely on a longer memo in which deputy attorney general rod rosenstein recommend that comey be dismiss over his mishandle of the hillary clinton email scandal during the campaign a white house spokesman tell politico that trump do not request the letter and have no idea that they be come a new york contributor roger parloff note this memo might have make sense if it be issue on day one of the trump administration but for it to suddenly come out on may after the nation have watch and listen to trump warmly defend and commend comey s conduct in countless tweet and interview render it content simply incredible plus the president s short letter to comey say nothing about the clinton probe but reference the investigation into the trump campaign s possible russia tie say i greatly appreciate you inform me on three separate occasion that i be not under investigation sure enough several outlet report early on wednesday morning that comey s dismissal be actually about trump s anger over the fbi s russia probe and comey s medium appearance the president have reportedly be mull the move for at least a week and maybe much longer it appear this moment from january when trump greet comey by blow him a kiss and comment oh and there s jam he s become more famous than me be a sign that comey s day a director be number accord to the wall street journal in recent month trump become irritate that comey be receive more medium attention and wasn t use his newfound fame to quash the rumor about trump s russia tie the more jam comey show up on television discus the fbi s investigation into possible tie between the trump campaign and russia the more the white house bristle accord to aid to president donald trump frustration be grow among top associate of the president that mr comey in a series of appearance before a senate panel wouldn t publicly tamp down question about possible collusion with russian interference in the presidential race a person with knowledge of recent conversation say they want mr comey to say those three little word there s no tie politico report that trump be particularly angry about comey confirm to the senate in march that the fbi have be investigate his campaign since last summer and the director s refusal to back up his claim that president obama wiretapped him he d even take to shout at his tv over the russia investigation he have grow enrage by the russia investigation two adviser say frustrate by his inability to control the mushroom narrative around russia he repeatedly ask aid why the russia investigation wouldn t disappear and demand they speak out for him he would sometimes scream at television clip about the probe one adviser say only a handful of top adviser include session and rosenstein know trump be plan to fire comey accord to cnn the pair start fine tune their rationale for fire comey after they learn trump want him go it appear those in the know seriously underestimate the ramification of the president dismiss the official lead an investigation into his campaign source tell politico that the white house think comey s fire would be win win since he d be criticize by both democrat and republican trump call several senator to inform them of his decision on monday even and be reportedly take aback when senate minority leader chuck schumer tell him he be make a huge mistake nevertheless trump s security aide keith schiller be send to personally deliver comey s dismissal letter to fbi headquarter apparently the white house be unaware that comey be in los angeles on tuesday like comey himself many top white house official only learn what have happen from medium report yet trump be reportedly annoy that his staff be catch off guard one source familiar with the president s reaction to tv coverage of the comey fire tell cnn that trump be upset because he perceive that nobody be defend him on the cable network so he dispatch top communication aid sean spicer kellyanne conway and sarah huckabee sander to appear on television to defend the white house the source say while trump be know to put a lot of stock in how thing play on cable news in general the white house doesn t seem all that concern about the optic of the situation hour after the news break the white house announce that trump will meet with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov on wednesday and a justice department official suggest that there could be more fire there be a lot of clean house that need to be do the official say
2566,with an unanticipated coup de th tre donald trump fire fbi director jam comey yesterday may comey learn of his dismissal from cable news report while at an event on talent acquisition and diversity at the fbi it be so unexpected that the former fbi director apparently think it be a joke accord to the official version of what transpire the trump administration decide to fire comey in large part because of his handle of the investigation into hillary clinton s email but the fact that comey be in charge of investigate potential tie between the trump administration and russia seem too coincidental to overlook many pundit have also point out the parallel between trump s decision and president richard nixon s notorious saturday night massacre when nixon fire the special prosecutor investigate the watergate scandal trump s administration have already weather it fair share of scandal the maelstrom of medium coverage and the confuse and contradictory explanation offer by trump aid can make it difficult to discern which story be actually problematic and which be more smoke than fire so how big a deal be comey s fire to gauge this we first need to know the real reason motivate trump and his attorney general with the administration stick to it story for now here be a rank of possible scenario trump fire comey because his mistake make the fbi look bad rank easy d on may comey testify in front of the senate judiciary committee during this appearance he say that hillaryclinton s top aide huma habedin have forward hundred and thousand of email to her husband anthony weiner some of which be classify so that weiner could print them out that claim turn out to be incorrect accord to the white house it be also the last straw comey have mishandle the clinton investigation since the very begin the administration use this last mistake a a reason to finally pull the plug on him if plain incompetence be indeed the real reason behind comey s fire it would represent the least concern scenario a quartz have already point out the decision could have be manage more elegantly and the time be bizarre a most of comey s allege mistake happen month ago then again delay fire be one of trump s speciality the silver line if trump be truly commit to investigate russia s allege meddle and this be a huge hypothetical if he may be more likely to appoint an independent special prosecutor to pick up comey s investigation trump fire comey because he wouldn t investigate wiretapping at trump tower rank sad trump be a master conspiracy theorist especially when it come to the circumstance of his own election whether claim clinton benefit from million of illegal vote or argue with the national park service over the crowd at his inauguration trump by his own admission believe the truth be not absolute one of trump s strongly hold opinion be the unproven claim that president obama tap his phone during the campaign relatedly it s possible that when comey refuse to substantiate the conspiracy the president grow increasingly frustrate and eventually decide to cook up an excuse to get rid of the fbi director comey s bungle testimony regard the clinton email represent the perfect opportunity a vindictive president who believe in alternative fact and doesn t like be question be an unpredictable president partisanship be bad enough president should not allow their personal bias to dictate policy and professional duty trump fire comey because of the russia investigation rank total disaster but what if trump be truly attempt to use his executive power to halt an investigation and potentially enable a cover up this be the worst case scenario comey be reportedly expand the investigation into russia s allege involvement in the presidential election in this last and most trouble scenario trump eager to hinder the fbi s search or simply wish to avoid a prolong pr disaster instruct his staff to find an excuse no matter how old to cut the head off the proverbial snake attorney general jeff session who have publicly recuse himself from the russia investigation be involve in the decision of remove comey and will be involve in choose the next fbi director if impede the fbi s investigation really be the objective trump will now be able to select a prosecutor friendly to the white house whoever be select will also have their predecessor s fate a a reminder of what happen to director who dare challenge the president in such a scenario it be also unlikely the attorney general who help him get rid of comey would appoint a special prosecutor
2567,donald trump have say he be think of this russia thing when he decide jam comey s fate contradict the white house rationale that he fire the fbi director for mishandle the clinton email investigation comey have be lead an investigation into possible collusion between trump adviser and russian official when he be dismiss by the president defend that decision in an interview on nbc news on thursday trump say and in fact when i decide to just do it i say to myself i say you know this russia thing with trump and russia be a make up story it s an excuse by the democrat for have lose an election that they should ve win trump also say there be three occasion on which comey assure him he be not under investigation the president say he call the director of the fbi to ask for an update on a possible criminal investigation into his tie with russia act fbi head dispute white house claim comey have lose staff support read more in the nbc interview trump also flatly contradict his own vice president and spokesman by say he decide to fire jam comey before receive a recommendation from the deputy attorney general trump recall three conversation with comey about the fbi investigation into russian interference in last year s presidential election first he say there be a dinner which be also about comey s future raise the prospect that trump could threaten his job he want to stay on at the fbi trump say and i say i ll you know consider and see what happen but we have a very nice dinner and at that time he tell me you be not under investigation act fbi director refute claim that staff lose faith in comey then there be two phone call one make by trump another by comey the president admit i actually ask him yes i say if it s possible would you let me know be i under investigation he say you be not under investigation the revelation be likely to trigger a fresh storm of criticism perception that trump fire comey because of the russian investigation have be central to the controversy surround the dismissal meanwhile trump ask whether he be under investigation would not be illegal but highly irregular on thursday trump s word earn immediate comparison with then attorney general loretta lynch s controversial meet with bill clinton last june during the investigation into hillary clinton s use of a private email server while secretary of state matthew miller a former spokesman for the department of justice tell msnbc it s completely inappropriate for trump to ask that question it would also be a violation of doj rule for jam comey to answer it ask at thursday s white house press brief if it be inappropriate for trump to have ask comey if he be under investigation deputy press secretary sarah huckabee sander say no i don t believe it be she add i don t see it a a conflict of interest and neither do many of the legal scholar who ve be comment on it over the last hour sander do not identify which legal scholar that she be refer to when the president fire comey on tuesday the white house release a memo from deputy attorney general rod rosenstein that criticise comey for mishandle last year s investigation into hillary clinton s email press secretary sean spicer claim it be this memo that prompt trump to remove comey a position back by vice president mike penny on wednesday penny say in an interview with cnn that trump have make a decision to accept the recommendation of the deputy attorney general and the attorney general to remove director comey but in the nbc interview trump say of comey he s a showboat he s a grandstander the fbi have be in turmoil you know that i know that everybody know that you take a look at the fbi a year ago it be in virtual turmoil le than a year ago it hasn t recover from that he explain i be go to fire comey my decision i be go to fire comey there s no good time to do it by the way i be go to fire regardless of recommendation the revelation come amid a flurry of report suggest that trump have grow increasingly irate with comey in recent week because of his high profile his failure to stop leak his pursuit of the russia investigation and his lack of support for the president s claim that he be wiretapped by barack obama in the end he fire comey late on tuesday afternoon a move that seem to take many white house staff by surprise the official reason give be the fbi director s mishandle of the investigation into clinton s email the act head of the fbi meanwhile say on thursday that comey enjoy broad support among it staff directly contradict the white house assertion that he have lose the confidence of the fbi rank and file confront at a senate intelligence committee hear with the claim of comey s unpopularity andrew mccabe say that be not accurate i can tell you i work very very closely with comey from the time we start at the washington field office he say i hold director comey in the highest regard for his considerable ability and his integrity it be the greatest honour of my professional life to have work with him he enjoy broad support in the fbi and he still do to this day the vast majority of fbi staff enjoy a deep and positive connection to director comey in contrast sander tell reporter on thursday that she have be in contact with countless fbi agent via text and email who express their support for the decision she do not identify them or explain why a white house press staffer would be in contact with fbi agent earlier on thursday sander tell cbs news trump be very likely to visit fbi headquarter in the next few day but later the msnbc network report that the visit would not be happen after agency official tell the white house that trump would not be greet warmly make his first public appearance since comey s dismissal mccabe promise to tell the senate committee if he come under pressure to shut down the investigation into possible link between trump s associate and russia during last year s election he say he have meet trump this week but the russian investigation do not come up ask by senator marco rubio if comey s abrupt dismissal would impede the work of the fbi mccabe be adamant you cannot stop the men and woman of the fbi from do the right thing and uphold the constitution he say later he say the russian investigation would be pursue vigorously and completely to report of comey have ask for more resource for the investigation mccabe say he be not aware of any such request and insist the russian investigation have the resource it need open the hear on global threat that hear evidence from the head of the main u intelligence agency the committee s republican chairman richard burr say it would not be solely focus on the trump russia enquiry however democratic senator repeatedly return to the issue it be impossible to ignore that one of the leader of the intelligence community be not here with u today say the top democrat on the committee mark warner the president s fire of fbi director comey be a shock development the time of director comey s dismissal to me and many committee member on both side of the aisle be especially trouble he be lead an active counterintelligence investigation into any link between the trump campaign and the russian government or it representative and whether there be any coordination between the campaign and russia s effort to interfere in our election for many people include myself it be hard to avoid the conclusion that the president s decision to remove director comey be relate to this investigation and that be unacceptable it emerge on wednesday even that the committee have issue a subpoena for the president s former national security adviser michael flynn request document relevant to the committee s investigation into russian interference with the election comey who find out he have be fire when the news flash up on a screen behind him when he be address staff in los angeles send a farewell letter to fbi staff on wednesday it be very hard to leave a group of people who be commit only to do the right thing he write my hope be that you will continue to live our value and the mission of protect the american people and uphold the constitution
2568,a genetically modify gm food be start to intrude in our diet concern have be express regard gm food safety these concern a well a the limitation of the procedure follow in the evaluation of their safety be present animal toxicity study with certain gm food have show that they may toxically affect several organ and system the review of these study should not be conduct separately for each gm food but accord to the effect exert on certain organ it may help u create a better picture of the possible health effect on human be the result of most study with gm food indicate that they may cause some common toxic effect such a hepatic pancreatic renal or reproductive effect and may alter the hematological biochemical and immunologic parameter however many year of research with animal and clinical trial be require for this assessment the use of recombinant gh or it expression in animal should be re examine since it have be show that it increase igf which may promote cancer
2569,you don't have to look hard to find genetically modify food on supermarket shelve more than percent of the corn and soy grow in the unite state come from seed whose dna have be rejiggered to increase yield and those two crop play star role in countless process food from soda to salad dress to bread advocate say genetically modify gm food allow farmer to produce more with fewer chemical which mean a cleaner environment and cheaper grocery for u all but the question remain what impact do gm food have on our health the answer be no one really know gm food have be on the market only since and research on their long term effect on human be scarce to date most of the study have be do on animal worryingly though some of those study link gm food to alter metabolism inflammation kidney and liver malfunction and reduce fertility in one experiment multiple generation of hamster be feed a diet of gm soy by the third generation they be lose the ability to produce offspring produce about half a many pup a the non gm soy group in addition allergy sufferer worry that a gene be transfer between plant allergenic protein from say peanut or wheat will pop up in unexpected place like soy or sugar richard goodman phd a professor of food science and technology at the university of nebraska lincoln and a former scientist for monsanto say that seed company run sophisticate test to prevent that kind of mistake from happen but insert new gene into a seed's delicately construct genome be always a gamble because scientist can't predict all the consequence there be for example the possibility of create brand new allergen despite the potential health implication more gm food appear each year in the usda approve the plant of genetically enhance sugar beet sucrose and alfalfa hay for livestock the fda be expect to okay a fast grow salmon in the near future and possibly on the horizon pig design to produce omega s yet because gm food be not require to be label a such it's impossible for consumer to tell them apart from regular food gary hirshberg chairman and cofounder of stonyfield the organic yogurt company think that's not right last october he partner with just label it a national coalition of nearly organization that's currently petition the fda to give consumer a choice more than people have already sign to add your name go to justlabelit org the status quo be innocent until prove guilty say ashley koff a register dietitian who study gm food a it be for trans fat ddt and countless other harmful chemical a label requirement would motivate seed company to prove to consumer that their product be safe to protect their sale nearly other country include china brazil and most european nation have mandate that genetically modify organism gmos be mark and in an msnbc online poll percent of more than respondent say that they should be label at press time state have introduce legislation to promote gmo label hirshberg for one remain impatient i'm he say i don't want to wait another year to see what the science say at this point i want to decide for myself
2570,over the past few year a number of country have completely ban gmos and the pesticide that go along with them and they be do so for a reason the latest country to consider a complete ban be russia after top government scientist recommend at least a year ban the truth be we don t know enough about gmos to deem them safe for human consumption believe it or not the very first commercial sale of them be only twenty year ago there be no possible way that our health authority can test all possible combination on a large enough population over a long enough period of time to be able to say with absolute certainty that they be harmless there be a multitude of credible scientific study that clearly demonstrate why gmos should not be consume and more be emerge every year there be also a number of scientist all around the world that oppose them by slip it into our food without our knowledge without any indication that there be genetically modify organism in our food we be now unwittingly part of a massive experiment the fda have say that genetically modify organism be not much different from regular food so they ll be treat in the same way the problem be this geneticist follow the inheritance of gene what biotechnology allow u to do be to take this organism and move it horizontally into a totally unrelated specie now david suzuki doesn t normally mate with a carrot and exchange gene what biotechnology allow u to do be to switch gene from one to the other without regard to the biological constraint it s very very bad science we assume that the principal govern the inheritance of gene vertically apply when you move gene laterally or horizontally there s absolutely no reason to make that conclusion geneticist david suzuki if anybody ever tell you that we know with one hundred percent certainty that gmos be totally safe to eat they haven t do their research there be no reason gm food should be approve safe for consumption we just don t know enough about them we could easily fee the planet through organic gmo free method there be absolutely no reason we need gm food around below i ve present just a bite of information to get you start on your research if you re interest multiple toxin from gmos detect in maternal and fetal blood research from canada the first of it kind have successfully identify the presence of pesticide associate with genetically modify food in maternal fetal and non pregnant woman s blood they also find the presence of monsanto s bt toxin the study be publish in the journal reproductive toxicology in you can read the full study here give the potential toxicity of these environmental pollutant and the fragility of the fetus more study be need particularly those use the placental transfer approach thus our present result will provide baseline data for future study explore a new area of research relate to nutrition toxicology and reproduction in woman today obstetric gynecological disorder that be associate with environmental chemical be not know thus know the actual concentration of genetically modify food in human constitute a cornerstone in the advancement of research in this area the study use blood sample from thirty pregnant woman and thirty non pregnant woman the study also point out that the fetus be consider to be highly susceptible to the adverse affect of xenobiotics foreign chemical substance find within an organism that be not naturally produce this be why the study emphasize that know more about gmos be crucial because environmental agent could disrupt the biological event that be require to ensure normal growth and development dna from genetically modify crop can be transfer into human who eat them in a new study publish in the peer review public library of science plo researchersemphasize that there be sufficient evidence that meal derive dna fragment carry complete gene that can enter into the human circulation system through an unknown mechanism in one of the blood sample the relative concentration of plant dna be higher than the human dna the study be base on the analysis of over human sample from four independent study plo be an open access well respect peer review scientific journal that cover primary research from discipline within science and medicine it s great to see this study publish in it confirm what many have be suspect for year our bloodstream be consider to be an environment well separate from the outside world and the digestive tract accord to the standard paradigm large macromolecule consume with food cannot pas directly to the circulatory system during digestion protein and dna be think to be degrade into small constituent amino acid and nucleic acid respectively and then absorb by a complex active process and distribute to various part of the body through the circulation system here base on the analysis of over human sample from four independent study we report evidence that meal derive dna fragment which be large enough to carry complete gene can avoid degradation and through an unknown mechanism enter the human circulation system in one of the blood sample the relative concentration of plant dna be higher than the human dna the plant dna concentration show a surprisingly precise log normal distribution in the plasma sample while non plasma cord blood control sample be find to be free of plant dna this still doesn t mean that gmos can enter into our cell but give the fact gmos have be link to cancer later in this article it be safe to assume it be indeed a possibility the bottom line be that we don t know and this study demonstrate another cause for concern new study link gmos to gluten disorder that affect million american this study be recently release by the institute for responsible technology irt and use data from the u department of agriculture u environmental protection agency medical journal review a well a other independent research the author relate gm food to five condition that may either trigger or exacerbate gluten relate disorder include the autoimmune disorder celiac disease intestinal permeability imbalanced gut bacteria immune activation and allergic response impair digestion damage to the intestinal wall the institute for responsible technology be a world leader in educate policy maker and the public about gmo food and crop the institute report and investigate on the impact gm food can have on health environment agriculture and more study link genetically modify corn to rat tumor in november the journal of food and chemical toxicology publish a paper title long term toxicity of a roundup herbicide and a roundup tolerant genetically modify maize by gilles eric seralini and his team of researcher at france s caen university it be a very significant study which obviously look bad for the big bio tech company like monsanto be the first and only long term study under control condition examine the possible effect of a diet of gmo maize treat with monsanto roundup herbicide this study have since be retract which be odd because the journal it be publish in be a very well know reputable peer review scientific journal in order for a study to be publish here it have to go through a rigorous review process it s also important to note that hundred of scientist from around the world have condemn the retraction of the study this study be do by expert and a correlation between gmos and these tumor can t be deny something happen the multiple criticism of the study have also be answer by the team of researcher that conduct the study you can read them and find out more about the study here gm crop production be lower u yield and increase pesticide use glyphosate induce human breast cancer cell growth via estrogen receptor a study be publish in the u national library of medicine and will soon be publish in the journal food and chemical toxicology several recent study show glyphosate s potential to be an endocrine disruptor endocrine disruptors be chemical that can interfere with the hormone system in mammal these disruptors can cause developmental disorder birth defect and cancer tumor glyphosate exert proliferative effect only in human hormone dependent breast cancer we find that glyphosate exhibit a weaker estrogenic activity than estradiol furthermore this study demonstrate the additive estrogenic effect of glyphosate and genisein which imply that the use of contaminate soybean product a dietary supplement may pose a risk of breast cancer because of their potential additive estrogenicity researcher also determine that monsanto s roundup be consider an xenoestrogen which be a foreign estrogen that mimic real estrogen in our body this can cause a number of problem that include an increase risk of various cancer early onset of puberty thyroid issue infertility and more glyphosate link to birth defect a group of scientist put together a comprehensive review of exist data that show how european regulator have know that monsanto s glyphosate cause a number of birth malformation since at least regulator mislead the public about glyphosate s safety and in germany the federal office for consumer protection and food safety tell the european commission that there be no evidence to suggest that glyphosate cause birth defect our examination of the evidence lead u to the conclusion that the current approval of glyphosate and roundup be deeply flaw and unreliable in this report we examine the industry study and regulatory document that lead to the approval of glyphosate we show that industry and regulator know a long ago a the s and s that glyphosate cause malformation but that this information be not make public we demonstrate how eu regulator reason their way from clear evidence of glyphosate s teratogenicity in industry s own study to a conclusion that minimize these find in the eu commission s final review report here be a summary of the report multiple peer review scientific literature document serious health hazard pose by glyphosate industry include monsanto have know since the s that glyphosate cause malformation in experimental animal at high dose industry have know since that these effect could also occur at lower and mid dose the german government have know since at least that glyphosate cause malformation the eu commission s expert scientific review panel know in that glyphosate cause malformation the eu commission have know since that glyphosate cause malformation this be the year dg sanco division publish it final review report lay out the basis for the current approval of glyphosate another study publish by the american chemical society from the university of buenos air argentina also show that glyphosate can cause abnormality the direct effect of glyphosate on early mechanism of morphogenesis in vertebrate embryo open concern about the clinical find from human offspring in population expose to glyphosate in agricultural field study link glyphosate to autism parkinson s and alzheimer s when you ingest glyphosate you be in essence alter the chemistry of your body it s completely unnatural and the body doesn t resonate with it p cyp be the gene pathway disrupt when the body take in glyphosate p create enzyme that assist with the formation of molecule in cell a well a break them down cyp enzyme be abundant and have many important function they be responsible for detoxify xenobiotics from the body thing like the various chemical find in pesticide drug and carcinogen glyphosate inhibit the cyp enzyme the cyp pathway be critical for normal natural function of multiple biological system within our body because human that ve be expose to glyphosate have a drop in amino acid tryptophan level they do not have the necessary active signal of the neurotransmitter serotonin which be associate with weight gain depression and alzheimer s disease chronically ill human have higher glyphosate level than healthy human a new study out of germany conclude that glyphosate residue could reach human and animal through fee and can be excrete in urine it outline how presence of glyphosate in urine and it accumulation in animal tissue be alarm even at low concentration to this day monsanto continue to advertise it roundup product a environmentally friendly and claim that neither animal nor human be affect by this toxin environmentalist veterinarian medical doctor and scientist however have raise increase alarm about the danger of glyphosate in the animal and human food chain a well a the environment the fact that glyphosate have be find in animal and human be of great concern in search for the cause of serious disease amongst entire herd of animal in northern germany especially cattle glyphosate have repeatedly be detect in the urine feces milk and fee of the animal even more alarm glyphosate be detect in the urine of the farmer study link gmo animal fee to severe stomach inflammation and enlarge uterus in pig a study by scientist judy carman phd that be recently publish in the peer review journal organic system outline the effect of a diet mix with gmo fee for pig and how it be a cause for concern when it come to health scientist randomize and feed isowean pig either a mix gm soy and gm corn maize diet for approximately week nothing out of the ordinary for most pig in the unite state which be unfortunately the normal lifespan of a commercial pig from wean to slaughter equal number of male and female pig be present in each group the gm diet be associate with gastric and uterine difference in pig gm pig have uterus that be heavier than non gm feed pig gm feed pig have a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation with a rate of compare to of non gm feed pig the study conclude that pig feed a gmo diet exhibit a heavier uterus and a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation than pig who weren t feed a gmo diet because the use of gmo fee for livestock and human be so widespread this be definitely another cause for concern when it come to gmo consumption human have a similar gastrointestinal tract to pig and these gm crop be consume widely by people especially in the unite state gmo risk assessment be base on very little scientific evidence in the sense that the test method recommend be not adequate to ensure safety deficiency have be reveal numerous time with regard to test gm food the first guideline be originally design to regulate the introduction of gm microbe and plant into the environment with no attention be pay to food safety concern however they have be widely cite a add authoritative scientific support to food safety assessment additionally the statement of policy release by the food and drug administration of the unite state presumptively recognize the gm food a gras generally recognize a safe be prepare while there be critical guideline prepare by the international life science institute europe and fao who recommend that safety evaluation should be base on the concept of substantial equivalence consider parameter such a molecular characterization phenotypic characteristic key nutrient toxicant and allergen since official standard for food safety assessment have be publish by the codex alimentarius commission of fao who publish review with around peer review study have find that despite the guideline the risk assessment of gm food have not follow a define prototype the risk assessment of genetically modify gm crop for human nutrition and health have not be systematic evaluation for each gm crop or trait have be conduct use different feed period animal model and parameter the most common result be that gm and conventional source include similar nutritional performance and growth in animal however adverse microscopic and molecular effect of some gm food in different organ or tissue have be report while there be currently no standardize method to evaluate the safety of gm food attempt towards harmonization be on the way more scientific effort be necessary in order to build confidence in the evaluation and acceptance of gm food so if anybody ever tell you that gmos be completely safe for consumption it s not true we just don t know enough about them to make such a definitive statement a lot of evidence actually point to the contrary source http w uclm e actividades

2571,activist often cite the allege potential health risk of genetically modify food one recent example of this scientific study prove gmos can be harmful to human health post on collective evolution com outline many familiar concern and point in each case to credible scientific study that clearly demonstrate why gmos should not be consume be these concern credible what do the study cite actually claim multiple toxin from gmos detect in maternal and fetal blood the blog post sit a study that allege to show this danger the author identify the bt protein cry ab in maternal and fetal blood a protein find in some gmos but also commonly use a a pesticide in organic farm the paper be flaw the researcher measurement be base on an experiment assay design to detect bt s cry ab in plant not in human a this post in biofortified org explain the pregnant woman in the study would have have to eat several kilo of corn in order to get the bt measurement that be detect in their blood additionally there s the so what factor human lack the receptor for the protein so it have no impact on u do you know that chocolate be toxic to dog be you concern that it might be toxic to you probably not if you be concern then you ve miss out on the greatest source of joy know to human taste bud some chemical compound behave differently among specie and both bt s cry ab and chocolate be example of this dna from genetically modify crop can be transfer into human who eat them that s not what the cite study conclude the author find that whole gene from our food can be detect in our plasma that do not mean that they ve integrate into our dna it mean that they ve be find float in the space between cell and that s any food not just gmos dna from gmos behave no differently than dna from organic or conventional food if you aren t concern about the dna from blueberry transfer into you then you should not be concern about dna from gmos either the paper s deepest flaw be that a negative control be not include in the sequence experiment several recent paper see here and here have outline the importance of include a negative control in experiment where there be very little dna to account for possible contaminant from the environment and reagent for a lay introduction to the concept of contaminant in sequence see here new study link gmos to gluten disorder that affect million american the article quote for an allege study by the institute for responsible technology irt but there be no study on the link of gmos to gluten allergy there s a link to a post on a webpage but there isn t a peer review article irt be a one man band run by activist jeffrey smith it be an ngo that advocate for the elimination of gmos from our food supply it s not a university college or research institution it doesn t do study i ve write about gluten allergy and gmos the celiac disease foundation have speak out against the irt s report gmo wheat have not be commercialize so any association of gluten allergy with the consumption of gmo wheat be on it face absurd a for chart that track an increase in gmo consumption in general and gluten allergy it s a case of association with no causation i e the incidence of gluten allergy have increase over the past decade and the amount of gmos we eat have increase too but so have the number of plasma screen manufacture study link genetically modify corn to rat tumor this claim be the infamous seralini paper which be retract and recently republish in a different journal without be peer review the paper identify tumor in rat that be feed gmos and or the herbicide glyphosate longterm but the strain of rat use be predispose to tumor the paper do not perform statistical analyse and use too few rat so it be not possible to determine if the tumor be due to the food the chemical or to the fact that the strain of rat would get tumor regardless of what they be feed finally the find from seralini s paper be contrary to other long term feed study an overview of the criticism regard this paper can be find here glyphosate induce human breast cancer cell growth via estrogen receptor this claim relate to glyphosate an herbicide use in tandem with herbicide resistant genetically modify crop the cite paper examine the impact of glyphosate on breast cancer cell growth in approximately percent of instance of breast cancer the diseased cell be hormone sensitive mean they need estrogen in order to proliferate and spread these researcher take two breast cancer cell line one be estrogen sensitive and one be not and they examine the impact of increase amount of glyphosate on cell growth they find that glyphosate have similar impact on breast cancer growth a estrogen although the relationship be not a strong and it do not have an impact on the proliferation of the non hormone sensitive breast cancer cell line the paper have numerous technical problem include the absence of data on control a potentially critical omission additionally there actually seem to be a protective effect at higher concentration of glyphosate instead of reach a saturation point where the addition of glyphosate no longer have an effect on cell growth there be no significant difference in cellular growth between the cell that receive the highest dose of glyphosate and the control which be why the data from the control be an important factor this experiment be do with cell in a petri dish what s call an in vitro tissue culture experiment such research be of limit real world value the cell be often finicky and need plenty of tlc in order to grow well different cell line can also behave very differently the author of the paper note some of these issue along with the fact that their data doesn t mesh with previous study that have examine the impact of glyphosate on cellular proliferation this previous paper suggest that glyphosate actually protect against cell proliferation in vitro in eight different cancer cell line and that glyphosate might be develop into an anti cancer drug monsanto write a response to the paper note that many study examine the potential carcinogenicity of glyphosate and none have find that the compound cause cancer some news report misinterpret the study write that researcher conclude that glyphosate cause cancer when that be not the researcher find they suggest glyphosate may cause breast cancer to proliferate monsanto point out that even this find be contrary to the body of evidence that exist on the topic the author admit to this fact and discus the appropriate next step to examine this issue in mouse rat model for breast cancer i think that that s a great next step i d also look at a few more breast cancer cell line this be the most compel research paper that i ve read about that suggest a potential health risk surround glyphosate but the study must be reproduce and it issue iron out however a i mention the paper isn t really about gmos a a class keep in mind that only a fraction of gmos be glyphosate resistant i e round up ready crop and the use of glyphosate be not limit to gmos additionally the paper do several experiment with a compound in soybean whose impact on breast cancer cell growth be very similar to that of glyphosate s mean that there be natural compound in our food that seem to have the same impact on breast cancer proliferation that this paper s find suggest for glyphosate there do not seem to be a scientific consensus on the topic of soy intake in breast cancer patient although several publication have examine this issue without find a positive correlation example here here and here glyphosate link to birth defect no peer review publish scientific study make such claim the source of this health concern be a publication by earth open source an anti gmo ngo co found by an individual who also own a gmo test and certification company and whose business would clearly benefit through the promotion of anti gmo sentiment see about the author in this document study link glyphosate to autism parkinson s and alzheimer s the paper that lead to this health claim do not constitute research it s a hypothesis and no research be do to support the hypothesis the paper be review by science journalist keith kloor at discover magazine who aptly compare it to a glenn beck chalkboard draw the claim be print in a pay for play journal also know a predatory journal mean that for a fee one can get nearly anything publish there have be several expo s on pay for play journal and many scientist believe that the phenomenon be erode the quality of science here s an overview from nature com here s an expo of pay for play journal chronically ill human have higher glyphosate level than healthy human this claim be base on a paper publish in the journal of environmental and analytical toxicology own by the omics publish group a notorious predatory publish company the author examine glyphosate level in human and different animal there s no indication of what the animal be feed how much how they be keep or myriad other variable any of these could invalidate the study the researcher do not say anything about the age sex weight height or genetic background of the human or how much they eat if they wash their food how long they have be eat organic conventional diet and most mind blow of all there s absolutely no definition for what constitute be chronically ill any single issue that i ve list here would be consider a fatal flaw that would exclude the paper from publication in a more prestigious journal study link gmo animal fee to severe stomach inflammation and enlarge uterus in pig in the study on which this claim be base the researcher give pig gmo fee and non gmo fee and identify the difference between the two group the paper have be thoroughly challenge by many journalist and scientist journalist mark lynas highlight the degree to which the data be cherry pick the difference in inflammation between the gm feed and non gm feed pig be apparent only when you break down the degree of inflammation into subcategories but there s no difference if you view it a a single category overall there s a high rate of inflammation for both group which be not explain in the paper at the same time there be several parameter where gm fee could be argue a have a protective effect there be percent fewer heart abnormality in pig feed gm grain but this isn t discus a explain by geneticist anastasia bodnar the author do not analyze the compositional difference in the fee between the two group previous study have determine that the environment i e water soil geography of a crop have a greater impact on protein and metabolite than whether or not the crop be a gmo a such the difference see in the pig may not be due pesticide or presence absence of the transgenic protein rather they be most likely due to difference in composition of the fee geneticist val giddings note that the animal have abnormally high rat of pneumonia which point to the possibility that something wonky be go on in conclusion even if the paper s find be real there s no know whether that s due to something associate with transgene or not because the researcher do not account for natural variation in the fee gmo risk assessment be base on very little scientific evidence in the sense that the test method recommend be not adequate to ensure safety let s set aside the fact that this isn t a scientific study prove gmos can be harmful to human health which be the claim set out in the title there be three paper associate with this bullet point the first one be a review and i agree with a few of the point it make it highlight the need for standardize test and statistic in animal feed study for gmos and anyone who follow the seralini debacle would probably agree it summarize paper that have perform feed study and their result however the review do not remove flaw paper from their overview and nor do it distinguish between feed study for gmo crop that have be commercialize v crop that have never be submit for regulatory approval the paper do not conclude gmo risk assessment be base on very little scientific evidence the second paper be also a review piece the first author be affiliate with friend of the earth an anti gmo ngo it do not constitute novel research and have a clear editorial slant the third paper do not even qualify a a review it s a commentary publish in in nature biotechnology which be a high caliber journal it outline possible unintended consequence that could happen with a gmo none of which have ever be document or identify since then to the best of my knowledge in conclusion despite the title of the article none of these study prove or even persuasively suggest that gmos can be harmful to human health the majority be either obviously flaw or be not scientific study the current scientific consensus regard gmos remain unchanged they be safe and do not pose a health risk to human however a scientific consensus be subject to change if there be sufficient reproducible evidence that may impact it but none of the study review here constitute such evidence
2572,it s be several month since the intelligence community conclude russia tamper in the election include steal democratic party email and give them to wikileaks yet an unfounded conspiracy theory persist that wikileaks actually get the email from a democratic national committee staffer who be shoot and kill in july seth rich who work on voter access project for the dnc be when he be kill early in the morning near his washington home ten month later the case remain unsolved though washington police have say they believe it be likely a botch robbery wikileaks publish ten of thousand of internal dnc email several day after rich die lead conspiracy theorist to speculate that the two event be relate wikileaks offer a reward for information about rich s murder the story be back in the news because on may a private investigator look into rich s case say he have evidence to prove the theorist right but the investigator a man name rod wheeler backtrack on his claim the next day and the rich family have send him a cease and desist letter say their son be not wikileaks source even so some right wing pundit continue to peddle this conspiracy most prominently on fox news among them be host sean hannity and former republican house speaker newt gingrich we have this very strange story now of this young man who work for the democratic national committee who apparently be assassinate at in the morning have give wikileaks something like email and attachment gingrich say on fox may nobody s investigate that and what do that tell you about what be go on because it turn out it wasn t the russian contrary to gingrich s statement the thin case that rich be the dnc leaker be in no way substantial enough to outweigh ample evidence that russia be the culprit two day after gingrich make this claim fox news retract it report promote this conspiracy theory scant evidence that seth rich leak the email the latest iteration of this story start when wheeler speak to a reporter with washington local news station wwtg tv on may wheeler work for the washington police in the s and be an occasional fox news contributor texas businessman ed butowsky another fox news contributor be finance wheeler s investigation wheeler tell wwtg tv he believe the local police and the fbi be engage in a cover up because of information find on rich s laptop and the relationship between the washington mayor s office and the dnc but you have source at the fbi say there be information that could link seth rich to wikileaks ask the wttg tv reporter absolutely wheeler reply yeah and that s confirm the next day a national fox news report say an unnamed federal investigator corroborate wheeler s find and accord to the federal investigator an fbi analysis of rich s laptop find that rich make contact with a wikileaks director and send him email and attachment from dnc leader here s the problem hour after fox publish it report wheeler recant he tell cnn that he hadn t see the evidence himself and his knowledge of rich s allege email contact with wikileaks come from the national fox news reporter not his own investigative work let me just really quickly say this wheeler say on hannity s show may i don't know for sure i don't know a a matter of fact if the email go out to the wikileaks or anybody else but it sure appear that way fox retract it own may article say the article be not initially subject to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our report so this allegation that rich be the real dnc leaker and relate insinuation that rich be murder because of it rest nearly entirely on claim from a single unnamed federal investigator with unspecified connection to the case the theory also doesn t make much logical sense no evidence have emerge that show rich be so disgruntle with the dnc that he felt the need to expose it leader to wikileaks further the leak email be overall rather mild they be embarrass and prompt rep debbie wasserman schultz of florida to step down from her role a dnc chair but they didn t expose any conspiracy or illegal activity all of this together make for a pretty flimsy case especially when compare to the broad consensus that russian actor be the true culprit lot of evidence russia steal then leak the email the intelligence community and private cybersecurity professional have widely conclude that the dnc hack and wikileaks dump be cover in russian fingerprint the technical method behind the hack be similar to those use by two russian intelligence group dub apt and apt also know a fancy bear and cozy bear and expert have say that dump large quantity of steal political information be a signature move of russian influence operation there s also the fact that wikileaks founder julian assange and the russian government have a well document relationship assange have host a television show on rt a state own network for example various intelligence agency reiterate russia s culpability in official report in october december and january and intelligence community leader and expert in russia and cybersecurity have say they agree with this conclusion in testimony before congress in the month since the final piece of russia's modern active measure surface in the summer of a hack material be strategically leak say clint watt senior fellow at the foreign policy research institute and former fbi special agent in a march senate hear the disclosure of wikileaks guccifer and dc leak demonstrate how hack would power the influence system russia have build so successfully in the previous two year there s evidence that russia engage in cyber operation against republican too though it wasn t a robust a the dnc hack the russian use cyber operation against both political party include hack into server use by the democratic national committee and release steal data to wikileaks and other medium outlet say former director of national intelligence jam clapper in a may hear russia also collect on certain republican party affiliate target but do not release any republican relate data our rule gingrich say dnc staffer seth rich apparently be assassinate at in the morning have give wikileaks something like email and attachment it turn out it wasn t the russian there be no trustworthy evidence support the theory that rich be wikileaks source for thousand of dnc email the police believe his death be the result of a botch robbery not a political assassination the intelligence community and cybersecurity expert have reach a broad conclusion that all the available evidence point to russia a the actual perpetrator base on technical indicator and an understand of how russian influence operation work gingrich and others be talk about an unfounded conspiracy theory a if it's a matter of fact it be far from it we rate his claim pant on fire
2573,on may fox news publish an explosive report link the death of murder democratic national committee staffer seth rich to ten of thousand of e mail allegedly find on his laptop computer fox report that the e mail be internal democratic national committee message rich transfer to gavin mcfayden a now decease investigative journalist who then send them to the document dump web site wikileaks the fox report claim that there be a conspiracy between the local police department the federal bureau of investigation and the d c mayor s office to cover up the investigation an fbi forensic report of rich s computer generate within hour after rich s murder show he make contact with wikileaks through gavin macfadyen a now decease american investigative reporter documentary filmmaker and director of wikileaks who be live in london at the time the federal source tell fox news i have see and read the email between seth rich and wikileaks the federal investigator tell fox news confirm the macfadyen connection he say the email be in possession of the fbi while the stall case be in the hand of the washington police department the revelation be consistent with the find of wheeler whose private investigation firm be hire by a third party on behalf of rich s family to probe the case my investigation up to this point show there be some degree of email exchange between seth rich and wikileaks wheeler say i do believe that the answer to who murder seth rich sit on his computer on a shelf at the dc police or fbi headquarter the federal investigator who request anonymity say email and attachment between democratic national committee leader span from january through late may be transfer from rich to macfadyen before may rich a year old dnc staffer be shoot twice in the back at in the morning on july amid the run up to the presidential election although none of his possession be take from him washington d c metropolitan police consider it a botch robbery attempt because there have be a spate of mugging in rich s bloomingdale neighborhood at the time almost two week later on july wikileaks dump a load of hack e mail that would embarrass the dnc and create a medium frenzy in the month before the election the time of the incident a well a rich s employment at the dnc lead to conspiracy theory tie his death to the leak add to the confusion wikileaks offer a reward for information lead to the conviction of rich s killer since his death rich s family have consistently deny rumor link him to wikileaks the fox news story about rich come one day after a report by the washington post accuse president donald trump of spill classify information to russian envoy during their visit to the oval office on may brad bauman a spokesperson for rich s family tell u he believe the fox story be motivate by a desire to deflect attention away from the post report i think there s a very special place in hell for people that would use the memory of a murder victim in order to pursue a political agenda the fox story use two source rod wheeler a fox news contributor characterize a a private investigator in the article and an unnamed federal investigator on may wheeler speculate to local news outlet fox that there be critical information on a computer that belong to him which be either in the possession of the fbi or mpd the police department nor the fbi have be forthcoming they haven t be cooperate at all i believe that the answer to solve his death lie on that computer which i believe be either at the police department or at the fbi i ve be tell both wheeler claim to have a source at the fbi that confirm rich be link to wikileaks and a source inside the police department who tell him mpd be tell to stand down from the investigation in a follow up interview on fox news wheeler imply that a conspiracy reach to the highest level of the city s government be at work i want to find out who cause that man s death so we can put them behind bar but if there s somebody in politics if there s somebody in government whether it s the mayor s office or anywhere else in this city that s involve you better believe they re go to be drag in and question we be able to confirm the fbi be not investigate rich s murder it be an mpd investigation we reach out to wheeler by e mail and have yet to receive a response but since the fox story be publish he have be quote in several news article recant his original story he tell buzzfeed news the follow day that story on fox last night be inaccurate i don t even know where the computer be on may the rich family attorney send wheeler a cease and desist letter say he have violate a contract forbid him to publicly disclose information about the case and threaten to sue if he continue to do so we contact the office of washington d c mayor muriel bowser to ask if there be a lurid connection between the mayor the dnc and rich s death and get a flat denial from spokesman kevin harris all claim make by mr wheeler be false and take fake news to a whole new level the family deserve better and everyday mpd continue to work diligently to solve this case we also ask the police department about wheeler s claim that the department be step back from the investigation a spokesperson for the department deny it and say that the investigation remain active the assertion put forward by mr wheeler be unfounded the metropolitan police department s mpd homicide branch be actively investigate mr rich s murder and we continue to work with the family to bring closure to this case a we do with all homicide investigation if there be any individual who feel they have information we urge them to call u at or text u at the department be offer a reward of up to for information on this case that lead to the arrest and conviction of the person or person responsible bauman say in a statement that wheeler be not authorize to speak on behalf of the family and add the family only learn of the new round of accusation through news report even if tomorrow an e mail be find it be not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interaction a e mail can be alter and we ve see that those interest in push conspiracy will stop at nothing to do so we be a family who be commit to fact not fake evidence that surface every few month to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from find seth s murderer the service of the private investigator who speak to press be offer to the rich family and pay for by a third party and contractually be bar from speak to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorize by the family mcfayden an investigative journalist who be an early defender of wikileaks die in october after a battle with lung cancer although the fox report claim wheeler be a private investigator a search for wheeler s name on the public lookup tool for license in washington d c yield no result we also check for a license under his name in maryland where his firm capitol investigation be base this search also yield no result when we ask mpd whether he be indeed a homicide detective with the department they only confirm he once work there start in he be dismiss by the department in but a spokesman do not explain why we send an e mail to wheeler through his firm and have not yet receive a response nbc news identify the third party who hire wheeler to investigate rich s murder a ed butowsky a dallas base financial adviser who be also a fox news contributor
2574,my investigation up to this point show there be some degree of email exchange between seth rich and wikileaks rod wheeler former dc homicide investigator wheeler make his comment on the possible rich wikileaks connection in a story first report monday night by fox dc in an appearance on fox news' hannity tuesday night wheeler say a federal investigator that be involve on the inside of the case saw rich's computer and the case file wheeler tell host sean hannity the investigator come across a very credible when you look at that with the totality of everything else that i find in this case it s very consistent for a person with my experience to begin to think 'well perhaps there be some email communication between seth and wikileaks ' but a spokesman for rich's family on tuesday say wheeler be not authorize to speak for the family and call assertion seth rich send email to wikileaks unsubstantiated brad bauman say even if purport email be to surface it would not necessarily mean rich have help wikileaks even if tomorrow an email be find it be not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interaction a email can be alter and we've see that those interest in push conspiracy will stop at nothing to do so bauman say we be a family who be commit to fact not fake evidence that surface every few month to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from find seth's murderer although bauman say wheeler be pay by a third party the family be name a client of wheeler's capitol investigation on a contract sign by rich's father joel rich the family have be sensitive to speculation that rich could have leak email damage to the dnc since he be murder during the height of the presidential campaign in a case that remain unsolved wheeler and the federal investigator insist that there be evidence to back their claim an fbi forensic report of rich's computer generate within hour after rich's murder show he make contact with wikileaks through gavin macfadyen a now decease american investigative reporter documentary filmmaker and director of wikileaks who be live in london at the time the federal source tell fox news i have see and read the email between seth rich and wikileaks the federal investigator tell fox news confirm the macfadyen connection he say the email be in possession of the fbi while the stall case be in the hand of the washington police department the revelation be consistent with the find of wheeler whose private investigation firm be hire by a third party on behalf of rich s family to probe the case my investigation up to this point show there be some degree of email exchange between seth rich and wikileaks wheeler say i do believe that the answer to who murder seth rich sit on his computer on a shelf at the dc police or fbi headquarter the federal investigator who request anonymity say email and attachment between democratic national committee leader span from january through late may be transfer from rich to macfadyen before may on july just day after rich be kill wikileaks publish internal dnc email that appear to show top party official conspire to stop sen bernie sander of vermont from become the party s presidential nominee that controversy result in debbie wasserman schultz resign a dnc chairperson wikileaks leader julian assange have stop short of identify rich a the source of the email but have take a keen interest in the case and have not deny work with rich wikileaks have decide to issue a u k reward for information lead to conviction for the murder of dnc staffer seth rich the organization announce assange have not return a series of recent email from fox news about rich macfadyen who be consider a mentor by assange die of lung cancer on oct at age washington s metropolitan police department have no suspect and no substantial lead a to who the killer or killer may be source close to the investigation say metropolitan police include the police chief have refuse to discus the case despite request from fox news date back month the department release a statement on the case say it remain an active investigation and that detective be work with rich's family if there be any individual who feel they have information we urge them to call u at or text u at read the statement the department be offer a reward of up to for information on this case that lead to the arrest and conviction of the person or person responsible the fbi s national office decline to comment but source say the bureau provide cyber expertise to examine rich s computer d c police have announce a reward for information lead to the conviction of rich s killer republican lobbyist jack burkman have offer a separate reward
2575,the life of seth rich a year old democratic national committee staffer end nearly a year ago when he be shoot to death near his house in washington dc then come the tragic and bizarre afterlife since july rich have be the focus of intense right wing conspiracy theory that have only escalate a the trump administration s scandal have deepen a the police have repeatedly state there be no evidence that rich s death be anything other than the consequence of a botch robbery but some people especially on the right believe rich be murder by the clinton for know too much about something the most recent theory claim that rich not the russian be responsible for leak the email publish in wikileaks that reveal democratic party leader have talk disparagingly about bernie sander thank to an erroneous fox news story last week which be finally retract on tuesday rich recently become the focus of an intense medium blitz from conservative outlet many of which be eager for something to talk about besides the scandal swirl around donald trump fox news s sean hannity be one of the most enthusiastic rumormonger devote segment on three separate occasion last week to rich even after fox news retract it story hannity promise he would continue to investigate i retract nothing he say defiantly on his radio show tuesday rich s family have be beg right wing news outlet to stop spread unfounded rumor about him but by now the situation seem to have get out of control in death rich have become a martyr to the right buoy by a host of character each with their own ulterior motif there be wikileaks founder julian assange who want to downplay the connection between wikileaks and the russian there be the clinton hater who want to spread the idea that the clinton be murderer there be the trump supporter who want to minimize the idea that russian hacker help deliver the election to their candidate and there be the talk head on fox news who last week need something other than negative trump story to make conversation about we might not know who kill seth rich but we do know who turn his legacy into a textbook study of where fake news come from how it spread and the victim it create seth rich be murder in a senseless act of violence seth rich work in democratic politics for most of his career he grow up and go to college in omaha nebraska where a a student he volunteer on two democratic senate campaign after graduate he move to washington dc for a job at greenberg quinlan rosner a progressive opinion research and consult firm he be later hire by the democratic national committee where he work on a project to help people find where to vote on sunday july rich be shoot to death about a block from where he live in the bloomingdale neighborhood of dc gunshot detection microphone place the time of the shoot at around be rich have last be see at around be leave lou s city bar in columbia height about a minute walk from where he live it be unclear exactly what happen during those three intervene hour the washington post report that accord to his parent cellphone record show that rich call his girlfriend at be and talk to her for more than two hour he hang up just minute before he be shoot the police find rich on the sidewalk with multiple gunshot wound at least two in the back he still have his watch his cellphone and his wallet there be sign of a struggle bruise on his hand knee and face and a tear wristwatch strap accord to the police report he be still conscious and breathe family member say they be tell that rich be very talkative though it be not publicly know if he be able to describe his assailant or assailant rich die a few hour later in the hospital the police suspect rich have be the victim of an attempt robbery bloomingdale be a gentrify part of washington that still suffer from violent crime in there be report robbery with a gun that occur within a quarter mile of the street corner where rich be shoot the first conspiracy theory grow out of the clinton body count rumor almost immediately after news of rich s death conspiracy theory begin circulate on social medium a few factor help make rich a target of speculation the murderer leave behind rich s valuable though by that same paranoid logic wouldn t a professional hitman have take rich s wallet and phone in order to make it look like a regular mug rich work at the dnc where in december there have be a minor scandal involve a software glitch that allow the bernie sander campaign to access private voter data collect by the clinton campaign hillary clinton have just clinch the nomination after a surprisingly bruise primary and there be still sore feel in the air there s a long run conspiracy theory that the clinton have assassinate dozen of their political enemy if those fact don t seem to add up to a coherent story well you re think too hard conspiracy theory don t operate logically they start from an assumption for instance the clinton be shady and spiral outward in search of corroboration on reddit for instance one user write a word post list thing that he find suspicious here be some of the stray fact the redditor claim be evidence of a hit job by the dnc or the clinton rich s former employer greenberg quinlan rosner once do some consult work for british petroleum be it possible that mr rich be aware of the public's disdain for oil industry fracking rich once work on ben nelson s campaign for senator nelson contribute a crucial vote to help pas obamacare back in the political convention be come up the time of this tragedy seem too 'coincidental it s unclear what any of these fact have to do with the clinton but somehow the reddit user conclude give his position time in politics i believe seth rich be murder by corrupt politician for know too much information on election fraud others on twitter and the troll website chan also speculate that rich might have cross the clinton in some way rich s death seem to fit in with the clinton body count theory which date to the s and claim that the clinton be so vindictive that they hire hitman to murder people they don t like people who believe the clinton be murderer often point to deputy white house counsel vince foster who suffer from clinical depression and die of a gunshot wind to the mouth in several investigation all rule foster s death a suicide but some conservative insist there must have be foul play they claim that foster who be look into the clinton tax may have uncover evidence of corruption in connection to the whitewater controversy a guilt by association scandal involve friend of the clinton the clinton body count theory have endure over the year simply because people don t live forever any time someone die who be connect to the clinton and since bill clinton be the president of the unite state literally thousand of people be in his orbit this theory be dredge up again by the tinfoil hat crowd and then it slowly fade at first it seem the speculation about seth rich would die down quickly a well but then day later on july wikileaks publish thousand of private email from the dnc and rich become a politically useful distraction julian assange and wikileaks supercharge the seth rich rumor a month before rich be murder the dnc admit that russian hacker have break into it computer network gain access to all of the dnc s email the think of russian interference in american politics be infuriate to rich accord to one person who be very close to him the washington post report it be crazy especially for seth he say oh my god we have a foreign entity try to get involve in our election that make him so angry when wikileaks release it dump of dnc email on july the obvious explanation be that it have obtain those email from the russian hacker this connection be later confirm by top u intelligence agency who conclude with high confidence that dnc server be hack by top russian government hacker who have then give the email to wikileaks moscow most likely choose wikileaks because of it self proclaim reputation for authenticity the u intelligence report explain a well a for it connection to the russian propaganda outlet russia today but wikileaks have repeatedly deny it tie to russia and ever since last summer it have use seth rich a a way to distract from claim that it abet russian interference in the u election wikileaks founder julian assange have his own reason to fear a clinton presidency a secretary of state clinton want to indict assange for his involvement in release the million of u diplomatic cable leak by chelsea man on dutch television in august assange hint that rich not russia may have be the source for the wikileaks email whistleblower go to significant effort to get u material and often very significant risk he say a a year old work for the dnc be shoot in the back murder just a few week ago for unknown reason a he be walk down the street in washington be he one of your source then the anchor ask we don t comment on who our source be assange reply then why make the suggestion about a young guy be shoot in the street of washington the anchor reply press repeatedly for clarification assange conclude that others others have suggest that we re investigate to understand what happen in that situation with seth rich i think it s a concern situation there s not a conclusion yet a part of it investigation wikileaks offer a prize in august for information about rich s murder this be the point where seth rich become a prop in a game of international espionage trump supporter and the alt right amplify the theory that rich be some kind of democratic whistleblower or leaker even though the fact didn t really fit this pattern he didn t have access to the dnc email and he have never show any prowess at hack be a data analyst involve a very different set of skill besides the dnc wasn t the only organization that be hack clinton campaign chair john podesta s personal email for instance be steal separately a be the email at the democratic congressional campaign committee nevertheless many on the right be inspire by the wikileaks insinuation and start to concoct their own conspiracy theory about rich s murder in august former house speaker and presidential candidate newt gingrich tell a conservative talk show host that rich s death be suspicious first of all of course it s worth talk about he say and if assange say he be the source assange may know that s not complicate that same month trump adviser roger stone claim without evidence that rich be murder on his way to meet with the fbi to discus election fraud to trump supporter the claim that rich have be murder by the clinton have twofold appeal it reinforce the rumor that the clinton be shady operative and it distract from the mount evidence that russia have interfere with the u election possibly in collusion with the trump campaign in the presidential debate on september trump famously suggest that it could have be a lone hacker who be responsible for the steal dnc email it could be russia but it could also be china it could also be lot of other people it also could be somebody sit on their bed that weigh pound he say thank to a weird miscommunication the conspiracy theory come back in may after the election the conspiracy theory about seth rich fade from public consciousness a the focus turn instead to the fbi s investigation of connection between trump staffer and russian agent suspicion still bubble in right wing corner of reddit and on alt right website like gateway pundit and assange continue to claim that it wasn t the russian who provide the hack email but most of america have move on but rich return to the news last week when the local tv station fox dc air an interview with private investigator rod wheeler who claim that source in the fbi tell him there be evidence of a connection between rich and wikileaks fox dc you have source at the fbi say that there be information wheeler for sure fox dc that could link seth rich to wikileaks wheeler absolutely yeah that's confirm conservative medium outlet jump on the story which air the night of monday may by tuesday morning conservative outlet like breitbart the blaze and the daily caller all have their own piece relay wheeler s claim on tuesday fox news add it own revelation it claim that an unnamed federal investigator have confirm that rich have be in contact with wikileaks i have see and read the email between seth rich and wikileaks the source say accord to fox news fox news additionally claim this source have evidence that rich have give thousand of dnc email to wikileaks this be a two source story the report also say that wheeler have independently corroborate what the anonymous federal investigator have tell fox news but here s where it get confuse by tuesday afternoon wheeler tell cnn that he have misspoken it turn out he didn t have any evidence of his own what have happen apparently be that earlier in the week fox news have contact wheeler for it own story on rich that be when wheeler learn that fox news have a source allege there be contact between rich and wikileaks when wheeler go on local tv on monday night to talk about rich he believe he be give viewer a preview of the fox news story set to run on tuesday that at least be how wheeler explain the situation to cnn last tuesday somehow through miscommunication or sloppy report the fox news report use wheeler to back up it claim about the rich wikileaks connection this be incorrect wheeler say he have no independent knowledge i only get that information from the reporter at fox news he tell cnn yesterday after leave it up for a week fox news finally retract it seth rich story which be down to one anonymous source the article be not initially subject to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our report an editor s note explain upon appropriate review the article be find not to meet those standard and have since be remove conservative medium have a field day it s unlikely that any of this would have be a big deal have there not be a stun series of damage report about donald trump last week among other thing it be reveal that trump have share state secret with the russian that he have pressure fbi director jam comey to drop his investigation into tie between trump affiliate and russia and that the russia probe have reach a current high level white house official who many suspect be trump s son in law jar kushner one way the conservative medium minimize all the bad news be to focus on other story the latest seth rich allegation become a welcome distraction from the constant revelation come out of the washington post and the new york time for instance while most outlet be cover the revelation that trump have volunteer classify information to russian the alt right website breitbart devote it front page to the seth rich conspiracy breitbart even slam the mainstream medium for ignore the rumor about rich silence from establishment medium over seth rich wikileaks report be the title of one story fox news in particular devote outsize attention to the rich story repeatedly rehash the conspiracy theory on his pm show fox pundit sean hannity devote segment to rich on tuesday thursday and friday last week i'm not back off ask question even though there be an effort that nobody talk about seth rich he say on friday night on tuesday even after fox news retract the story that ignite the latest round of speculation hannity remain convince that the seth rich conspiracy theory have leg i be not fox com or foxnews com he say on his radio show i retract nothing later that even on his television show hannity say that for now he would stop talk about rich out of respect for the family's wish on twitter though he be defiant claim that liberal fascism be try to silence his voice ok to be clear i be closer to the truth than ever he tweet not only be i not stop i be work harder please retweet he add rich be an unlucky victim of the conservative medium the recent attention have reignite the old seth rich conspiracy theory bring forth even more unsubstantiated claim on fox news s sunday morning talk show newt gingrich repeat his belief that rich not russia be responsible for the dnc hack it turn out it wasn t the russian he say it be this young guy who i suspect be disgust by the corruption of the democratic national committee on monday assange issue a cryptic tweet use the hashtag sethrich which fan the flame even further wikileaks have never disclose a source source sometimes talk to other party but identity never emerge from wikileaks sethrich and on tuesday new zealand file share entrepreneur kim dotcom who be want by the u government for copyright infringement and racketeer claim that rich have personally contact him in and that the two have talk about a number of topic include corruption and the influence of corporate money in politics i know that seth rich be involve in the dnc leak dotcom write in a statement rich s family have repeatedly ask news outlet to stop publicize these rumor those theory which some reporter have since retract be baseless and they be unspeakably cruel mary and joel rich write in a washington post op ed on tuesday even imagine that instead every call that come in be a reporter ask what you think of a series of lie or conspiracy about the death they write that nightmare be what our family go through every day the rich also push back on some of the rumor themselves state that the fbi have find no evidence of communication between their son and wikileaks and that seth have no access to any of the dnc email that be leak despite these fact our family s nightmare persist seth s death have be turn into a political football every day we wake up to new headline new lie new factual error new people approach u to take advantage of u and seth s legacy it just win t stop the amount of pain and anguish this have cause u be unbearable with every conspiratorial flare up we be force to relive seth s murder and a small piece of u die a more of seth s memory be tear away from u but to conspiracy theorist the fact have never matter fake news always have ulterior motif and everybody who amplify the seth rich conspiracy theory have their own stake in keep the lie alive
2576,in january a group of cornell university undergraduate travel to the mekong river delta of vietnam a region of the world consider to be one of the most vulnerable to climate change there they meet with farmer climate expert government official and their peer and learn about the ominous change take place in the mekong that ultimately will impact u all the trip be part of course intend to help millennials better appreciate the interconnect and interdependent world they live in and to fully grasp what be ahead for vietnam and for them a grand challenge on a grand scale about the time these student turn sea level rise will have displace an estimate million resident of the mekong delta by much of the region will likely be underwater affect million more to say nothing about the impact on major american city include miami beach boston and new york that like the mekong have considerable real estate at risk from rise sea level change cause by rise sea level be already flood into the mekong delta especially in the rural area where vietnam grow much of it food our group of cornell student learn that rain now fall during what be once the dry season interfere with seed set and reduce rice yield increase salt water intrusion be force farmer to abandon rice altogether and switch to more salt tolerant option such a shrimp production and crop such a coconut and watermelon more groundwater be be use to dilute salty water for irrigation and drink which in turn result in land subsidence and exacerbate saltwater intrusion from this two week journey to a country mile from home and at the forefront of our greatest global challenge the student gather story to tell and share with the world because what be happen in vietnam will be repeat globally one of the first thing the student learn be that climate change be accept a fact in vietnam it be not politicize and be discus freely message to take home the vietnamese people do not avoid talk about the change climate it s happen in their own backyard say conor mccabe an animal science major class of climate change be definitely an uncomfortable topic since it have so many ramification for society and the livelihood of everyday people take part in that difficult discussion rather than shy away be what i plan to do from now on say becky cardinali an economics major class of these millennials also learn that despite the history of the vietnam war and the role the u s now play in exacerbate climate change the vietnamese people be extraordinarily welcome i felt so embarrass that i have contribute to the climate change that be destroy their livelihood how do they repay me by invite me into their home for tea they do not hate u in fact they be extremely welcome hopeful and forward look say marc alessi an up and come meteorologist class of one of the more salient moment during their visit occur when student hear a vietnamese government official explain that the evidence for climate change and it cause be well establish and for them it be not a hoax a the student observe climate change be not a hoax for the rest of the world nor be it a distant future threat my time in the mekong delta serve a a reminder that for many climate change be immediate say gail fletcher major in history and government class of in the unite state and vietnam along with nearly every other country on the planet sign the paris agreement on climate change commit them all to a goal of keep temperature rise to below c maybe eerily the peace accord that end the longest war in american history be also sign in paris a war that cost the live of u s troop many the same age a today s cornell student set all other issue aside the paris agreement must be back by all signatory the bond that can heal trouble relationship between country can be a share concern for the future of this planet otherwise a earth continue to warm and food become more scarce drive up price tension among country be only go to rise and result in more conflict more war regardless of your personal religious or cultural belief the earth be go to keep on warm and it be already happen in real life and be impact real people lady and gentleman it be time to wake up add jeff fralick environmental science and sustainability major class of climate change be not a hoax to these millennials member of one of the largest voter eligible block in the u s nearly in it be deadly serious and an issue that just might arouse this sleep giant it be their future and yours
2577,the basic science behind climate change be actually quite simple the story begin nearly year ago when irish physicist john tyndall discover carbonic acid today know a carbon dioxide be one of a number of perfectly colourless and invisible gas and vapour to absorb radiant heat he also realise just how important this be to life on earth a without such gas it would be hold fast in the iron grip of frost about year later the swedish scientist svante arrhenius first suggest that increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would cause the global temperature to go up particularly in the arctic but the idea remain mostly an academic question until a he predict the mercury start to rise this be one of the certainty in climate science the world have get warmer how do we know that the world have really warm up last year the hottest on record for the third year in a row be about degree celsius above the pre industrial level accord to nasa and the meet office boost slightly by the natural el nino effect svalbard in the arctic have see average winter temperature rise by up to a stagger c compare to the average between and in addition to thermometer record go back to the s there be a large amount of natural evidence in the form of glacier retreat and sea ice melt to record low sea level rise by cm island disappear animal and plant shift their range and spring come several week earlier ironically the famously impassable northwest passage which claim the live of numerous explorer try to find a new trade route to china be now so free of ice that people can take a cruise through it on a ship power by the fossil fuel that help cause global warm it be also certain that greenhouse gas in the atmosphere have increase and that human activity be responsible for this helpfully atmospheric carbon dioxide result from fossil fuel have a different isotope signature to the gas produce naturally a nasa put it there be no question that increase level of greenhouse gas must cause the earth to warm in response how do we know that warm have anything to do with human all this do not scientifically prove beyond all doubt that our greenhouse gas which also include water vapour nitrous oxide ozone and methane be cause global warm but the correlation between the two and the evidence of causation first supply by tyndall make a compel argument it be a near to certain a it be possible to get without conduct a planet scale experiment outside of conspiracy theorist crank and some of the rule u politician no one dispute the above be true even the uk s lead sceptic think tank nigel lawson s global warm policy foundation gwpf agree what will happen in the future some commentator include the gwpf adopt a so call lukewarmist position argue that climate change will not be too bad so there be no need to stop use fossil fuel they point to beneficial effect such a 'global greening' in which plant growth be boost by the extra carbon in the air others have claim humanity be plunge headlong towards catastrophe and possibly even a future in which a tiny band of survivor cluster around the last remain habitable territory near the pole both group be at odds with the science a professor tim palmer an oxford university physicist who have work on report for the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc explain in a recent talk at the royal society the scientific consensus on climate change be that it could be anything between those two extreme accord to computer model develop use mathematics the law of physic and the best available knowledge the world could be on course for between about c and more than c of warm a a result of the double of atmospheric carbon dioxide so far it have rise from about part per million a level that have remain fairly constant from the end of the last ice age to the s to more than ppm today when we talk about scientific consensus i would say it s basically about this temperature distribution it s not individual prediction professor palmer tell the royal society but accord to the model there be a much higher probability of go beyond c of warm than stay below this point often regard a when climate change become particularly dangerous and a professor palmer also point out there be also a non negligible probability of c or more which would be utterly catastrophic model be often the source of derision from climate sceptic or denier but they have actually prove remarkably successful when measure against actual observation even arrhenius prediction that the arctic would warm more quickly have prove to be true
2578,with hurricane matthew wreak havoc the leave be predictably seize the storm a a mean of promote their radical global warm agenda climate change have not be a major theme this election cycle but hillary clinton be now try to turn it into one with the help of global warm guru al gore unfortunately for the climate change alarmist despite all the celebrity endorsement and high mind rhetoric the fact keep get in the way here be nine thing you need to know about the climate change hoax the climategate scandal prove that key data involve man make climate change be manipulate in the public discover email from the university of east anglia's climatic research unit expose how scientist who have be enormously influential in promote the concept of man make climate change actually attempt to cook the book to obtain result that serve their narrative that the planet be heat at a dangerous trend due to higher level of carbon dioxide one of these scientist include dr jam hansen a former nasa climatologist who be know by some a the father or grandfather of the climate change myth a it be his model zero that first introduce the concept of global warm hansen philip jones michael mann et al be all involve in try to lower past temperature and to 'adjust' recent temperature upwards in order to convey the impression of an accelerate warm accord to the leak email the email also reveal how this cabal of scientist would discus various way to stonewall the public from see the background data on which their find and temperature record be base even go a far a delete significant amount of data they would engage in effort to smear any scientific journal which dare to publish their critics' work the climategate scandal be give new life in with the release of new email the new round of leak email at the time provide more teeth to the revelation of here be a couple of egregious email from jones find via forbes i ve be tell that ipcc be above national foi freedom of information act one way to cover yourself and all those work in ar would be to delete all email at the end of the process write phil jones a scientist work with the unite nation intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc in a newly release email any work we have do in the past be do on the back of the research grant we get and have to be well hide jones write in another newly release email i ve discus this with the main funder u s dept of energy in the past and they be happy about not release the original station data an email write by mann show that he try to get an investigative journalist to investigate and expose a climate skeptic scientist name steven mcintyre nasa may have also be involve in manipulate data to serve the narrative of man make climate change the washington time report in under pressure in nasa recalculate it data and find that not be the hottest year in it record for the contiguous state nasa later change that data again and now and be tie for first with slightly cooler since this occur at around the same time a the climategate scandal chris horner of the competitive enterprise institute file a lawsuit to get nasa to release their relevant data set on this issue and be able to expose email from nasa that reveal a disturb fact the agency admit that it own climate find be inferior to those maintain by both the university of east anglia's climatic research unit report fox news in mean nasa climate change data set be le accurate than the organization embattle with manipulate data set a washington time editorial also highlight another example of nasa cook the book paul homewood a skeptical researcher find that in paraguay temperature read for the th century at all nine weather station supervise by nasa have be adjust to transform a cool trend into a warm trend his analysis of read in the arctic find that rapid warm between and before human activity could have increase the production of greenhouse gas be adjust downward so that the s and s temperature would stand out a warmer nasa also declare to be the hottest year on record despite the fact that they be only percent sure about it the latter fact be leave out of their press release at the time a well a the fact that be supposedly hotter than the previous hottest year by c well within the margin of error of c that scientist tend to adhere by the washington post attempt to spin in favor of nasa by argue that nasa simply say that be the most likely hottest year on record but their press release unequivocally state that be the warmest year on record and leave out the aforementioned key fact make such a declaration seem mislead a it's clearly not a guarantee that be even likely the hottest year on record there be no evidence that the earth have be warm in recent year a the daily caller highlight a recent peer review study conclude that when account for el ninos and la nina which be the the fluctuation in temperature between the ocean and atmosphere in the east central equatorial pacific that occur on average every two to seven year accord to noaa there have be a flat line temperature trend since in fact the study find that the el ninos and la nina disprove the existence of the tropical hot spot which the environmental protection agency claim a evidence of carbon dioxide supposedly warm the atmosphere the leave like to claim that percent of scientist support the concept of man make climate change it's likely closer to percent the percent myth stem from a variety of flaw study a the daily wire explain here on the other hand the pbl netherlands environmental assessment agency conduct a survey in that find that only percent of scientist believe in man make climate change which be far from a consensus the amount of arctic sea ice have become quite high data from the danish meteorological institute show that the average ice extent over the month of september be one of the highest in the last decade accord to paul homewood this run directly counter to the prediction of the climate change model money from the federal government and leftist organization fuel a lot of misinformation from man make global warm alarmist climate change alarmism be an extremely lucrative industry all in all there have be over billion of federal government grant that have fund climate change research from far more than any research fund by the oil industry national review report last summer a minority staff report from the u s senate committee on environment and public work give detail on a billionaire s club a shadowy network of charitable foundation that distribute billion to advance climate alarmism shadowy nonprofit such a the energy foundation and tide foundation distribute billion to far leave green group such a the natural resource defense council which in turn send staff to the epa who then direct federal grant back to the same green group it be incestuous it be opaque major medium ignore the report mann one of the scientist mention earlier for his role in the climategate scandal receive nearly million in grant from the federal government the source of fund for scientist like hansen be unknown the federal government have be resist freedom of information act foia request to reveal them it be patently absurd to link hurricane matthew to climate change not just because of the aforementioned reason but because a marco morano point out at climate depot the data show for the last year we have have an unusual drought of landfalling major hurricane category and higher on the continental u s that s right no major hurricane have make landfall for over a decade morano continue this be the longest such drought on record
2579,one of the main line of evidence use by the obama administration to justify it global warm regulation doesn t exist in the real world accord to a new report by climate researcher researcher analyze temperature observation from satellite weather balloon weather station and buoy and find the so call tropical hotspot rely upon by the epa to declare carbon dioxide a pollutant simply do not exist in the real world they find that once el ninos be take into account there be no record set warm to be concern about these analysis result would appear to leave very very little doubt but that epa s claim of a tropical hot spot th cause by rise atmospheric co level simply do not exist in the real world read the report by economist jam wallace climatologist john christy and meteorologist joseph d aleo also critically important even on an all other thing equal basis this analysis fail to find that the steadily rise atmospheric co concentration have have a statistically significant impact on any of the critically important temperature time series analyze they write when epa release it co endangerment find in it use three line of evidence to bolster it argument that greenhouse gas threaten human health through global warm the crux of epa s argument rest on the existence of a tropical hotspot where global warm would be most apparent that be there should be enhance warm in the tropical troposphere the fingerprint of global warm epa s endangerment find be the legal basis for agency global warm regulation include the clean power plan cpp now be fight over in federal court cpp aim to cut power plant carbon dioxide emission percent by and could cost billion a year accord to independent estimate d aleo and his colleague look at the data and control for el ninos and la nina what they find be that once natural oceanic warm and cool event be account for there s no warm trend el nino be not by any mean new d aleo tell the daily caller news foundation the el ninos and la nina do not occur at a regular frequency but tend to cluster a we show in our paper tropospheric temperature be mainly measure by satellite and weather balloon which collect data from the lowest few mile of the atmosphere satellite already show only slight warm since but they be sensitive to el ninos and la nina remove el ninos and la nina from tropospheric temperature create temperature time series each have a flat trend basically d aleo and his colleague find oceanic warm event be responsible for virtually all the warm since when el ninos become more frequent and stronger on the flip side the recent hiatus in global warm can be explain by more frequent la nina accord to d aleo it be an accept fact that el ninos bring global warmth and la nina cool d aleo say it be thus not at all surprise that the period from to bring cool to warm and we have a flat trend from to current with el ninos and la nina adjust out of the data only volcano be leave base on epa assumption to impact the climate and d aleo s report acknowledge it be still possible that the volcanic activity be hide co s impact volcanic aerosol can have a cool effect on global average temperature the eruption of mt pinatubo cause a dip in satellite temperature data that last for a couple year the temperature data measurement that be analyze be take by many different entity use balloon satellite buoy and various land base technique read the report needle to say if regardless of data source the result be the same the analysis find should be consider highly credible climate scientist have be debate for year over the existence of the tropical hotspot christy who co run the premier satellite temperature dataset at the university of alabama in huntsville with climatologist roy spencer have present evidence that climate model overpredicted warm in the tropical troposphere ross mckitrick an environmental economist at the university of guelph in canada also run the number and find climate model overestimate warm in the tropical troposphere mckitrick provide evidence of a phase shift in from dominant el nina to el ninos just like d aleo christy and williams find over the year from to climate model not only significantly over predict observe warm in the tropical troposphere but they represent it in a fundamentally different way than be observe mckitrick write in a study
2580,climate change be the biggest scam in the history of the world a trillion a year conspiracy against the taxpayer every cent penny and centime of which end in the pocket of the wrong kind of people none of which go towards a cause remotely worth fund all of it a complete and utter waste nowhere be this truer in the field of the environment which i sincerely believe and i ve be do a lot of research into this must count among the biggest waste of tax money in the history of the world last year climate change business journal calculate that the total annual spend on the climate change industry be trillion a year all those carbon trader climate researcher renewables and biofuels expert environment correspondent professor of climate science at the university of east anglia and the potsdam institute sustainability officer on local council and so on add up the cost of their grant and salary and trillion per year be the ballpark figure you reach so what do trillion look like in a global economic context well it s roughly the amount we spend every year on the online shop industry trillion on the global warm industry trillion on the online shop industry but there s a key difference between these two industry one exist to provide buyer and seller what they want to their mutual benefit the other be a sham buy stuff on the internet it s really useful isn t it it have have a dramatically transform effect on our quality of life the way you can order a book at o clock on a sunday night and have it appear on your doorstep the very next day but how do this marvellous industry spring up be it because of all the special incentive and tax break grant by wise government nope of course not they weren t necessary the online shop industry spring up and grow and grow because it be what people want where they choose of their own volition to spend their money now compare and contrast the global warm industry which i call a potemkin industry because that s what it be a fraud a sham a conspiracy against the taxpayer do you want to have a guess how much that industry would be worth if it weren t for all the money funnel into it via government grant and taxpayer levy and subsidy and regulatory capture pretty close to zero i d say take wind farm my hobby horse the cost of intermittent unreliable wind energy be roughly twice the market rate for onshore wind three time the market rate for onshore nobody s go to pay that kind of money in the open market the only way it s go to happen if people be mandate by the government to do so which be what of course have happen across europe and in the u warren buffett have say it wind farm don t make sense without the tax credit they re inefficient they kill bird and bat they spoil view they re environmentally unfriendly rare earth mineral from china they re hazardous they re expensive they re ugly well i think they be and in few country be the damage these monstrosity have do more obvious than in germany home of the hateful energiewende energiewende mean energy transition it have be a disaster a rupert darwall note in a recent telegraph article in the green energy minister j rgen trittin claim that the extra cost of renewable energy on monthly bill be equivalent to the cost of a scoop of ice cream nine year later cdu minister peter altmaier say energiewende could cost around trillion by the end of the s the cost of fee in tariff and other subsidy be currently bn a year bn be be spend on a new north south high voltage line and investment in other grid infrastructure be likely to double that number they cause real people real misery in german household could not pay their electricity bill because energiewende have make them so expensive that s the financial damage they ve cause what about the environmental damage here we be in germany the greenest nation on earth aren t green suppose to care about animal well they don t about bat clearly bat be special the reason they re so heavily protect by so many law be that they be a k select specie that be they reproduce very slowly live a long time and be easy to wipe out have evolve with few predator fly at night help bat do very well with this strategy until the modern world but now we have all those eco friendly wind turbine or a i call them bird slice bat chomp eco crucifix a recent study in germany by the leibniz institute for zoo and wildlife research show that bat kill by german turbine may have come from place or more mile away this would suggest that german turbine which one study claim kill more than bat a year may be depress population across the entire northeastern portion of europe why would anyone put up such thing one reason and one reason only follow the money where do the money come from u who make the decision to spend that money not u oh definitely not u have it be u we might have do a bite of basic due diligence like ok so these wind turbine be necessary you say to save the planet from the threat of catastrophic and unprecedented man make global warm correct so have the planet ever be a warm in human history a it be today well only in the minoan warm period and the roman warm period and the medieval warm period just those right and presumably back then all that co heavy industry be burn be a real problem no just kid out of interest how much have the planet warm in the last few year about degree c since right so since the end of the little ice age so call because it be characterise by unpleasant cold and year like the infamous year without a summer the planet have heat by le than the temperature increase you d get on a spring day between say breakfast and mid morning coffee time ah yes but the computer model indeed the computer model those amaze model which have be predict catastrophic runaway warm when there have be no significant warm since so for eighteen year there have be no global warm ah yes but the temperature of february look i could go on like this forever i ve be listen to these increasingly desperate excuse for decade perhaps some of you here believe them if so there s a bridge i d like to sell you but it really doesn t matter whether you believe in global warm or not because here s the reality all that money we re be to spend on the global warm industry that trillion i mention earlier siphon straight out of taxpayer pocket it isn t go to make the blindest bite of difference no i exaggerate it will make a teeny weeny bite of difference bjorn lomborg have do the calculation you re go to love this if you haven t hear this before these figure be just amaze so recently you ll recall there be a big un climate conference in paris cop and all the leader of the world fly in to save the planet from global warm but before they turn up each delegate nation make a voluntary agreement a to how much it be go to cut it carbon emission not compulsory note so these country be free at any stage to abandon their carbon reduction target a funnily enough south korea do last week this be how much best case scenario that various country be prepare to do to combat climate change so lomborg add up all the country indcs that stand for intend nationally determine contribution and work out use the climate alarmist own model what effect all this would have on global temperature do you want to know how much oh this be the optimistic scenario by the way not the pessimistic one if all the country do their bite then the total reduction in global warm by the year will be degree centigrade a a climate sceptic friend of mine point out at the time you d experience a bigger temperature increase than that just walk down from the top to the bottom of the eiffel tower so there s your deal folk you and taxpayer like you be pay trillion a year to reduce the world s temperature by the end of this century by it s so perfectly ridiculous it s almost funny and i suppose on a personal level i shouldn t complain i call climate change the gift that go on give because day in day out i get an endless stream of story to write about the corruption incompetence skullduggery of the climate alarmism industry but put my career aside for the moment be this really a world we d like to live in can it be right that people who have work hard for their money should have it take from them and then waste in so spectacular fashion and it s not just the waste that s so bad it s worse than that if it be simply a form of taxpayer fund welfare scheme for otherwise unemployable environmental science graduate that would be one thing but this be cause real last harm in any number of way the corrupt effect on science and the scientific method which at time be almost redolent of lysenkoism of the stalin era the brainwash of schoolchildren such a you might have find with the young pioneer the economic damage cause by the misallocation of resource a so frequently happen in communist country the pollution cause by diesel introduce on eu recommendation because it s supposedly more co friendly which call to mind chernobyl or the poison of the aral sea the human suffer of those german household i mention who can t pay their electricity bill do this authoritarianism and corruption and incompetence remind you of anything well it have often be say and there be much anecdotal evidence to support this that after the berlin wall come down the leave have a bite of a problem capitalism have win the economic argument where could the leave go next but the solution be there wait them the green movement in the guise of save the world s environment they could advance all their usual obsession control regulation state intervention puritanism compulsory immiseration though this time with a smile fluffy face watermelon they call them green on the outside red on the inside so the berlin wall come down but it never really go away and sometimes i look at the world and what have be happen with the rise and rise of green lunacy and i ask myself do the right side really win the cold war or be it just an illusion
2581,yet more bad news for obamacare this week molina healthcare lose million on the exchange last year and the ceo tell investor there be simply too many unknown with the marketplace program to commit to our participation beyond at first glance it s hard to see why this piece of news be worth worry about unitedhealth recently project several time those loss and it's a bigger player on the exchange why spend so much time look at one modest size insurer because molina be one of the company that have be repeatedly point to by virtually every health care policy wonk in the business a one of the bright spot on the exchange molina be a company that specialize in cover poor people before obamacare they be a sizable player in the medicaid manage care model and it seem like the expertise they d thusly acquire be allow them to design the sort of plan that actually make money on the exchange which be to say bare bone plan not fancy but adequate apparently that s no longer a money maker at least for molina this isn t necessarily the pattern we ve see with other insurer molina seem to have make money until it be force to pay into a fund design to transfer money from insurer that end up with an unusually healthy patient pool to those who get stick with the sicker patient those loss be partially offset by lower medical cost than they expect which be certainly good news but it s not great news lower than expect cost can be from the system work well or they can simply come from the fact that you happen to get a healthier insurance pool if the government make you give the latter gain back and more then you re still not go to be profitable and insurer that aren t profitable over the long term aren t go to stick around nor can you fix the problem by adjust the transfer fund those loss be occur somewhere in the market someone have to pay for the care if you get rid of obamacare s risk transfer provision those insurer would lose more money and exit the market and the patient would end up with some other insurer who would then lose a bunch of money on them unless the insurance market be profitable in aggregate the exchange be not go to stabilize molina s loss suggest that instead of stabilize the exchange be get worse there be no way to fix obamacare without fix the pool so that younger healthier people buy insurance democrat have six year to come up with a way to do that or perhaps i should say a way to do that that could actually get through congress without horde of angry voter burn their representative in effigy they fail now republican be take their shoot and so far at least they don t seem any more on target than democrat be the life expectancy of the individual market for health insurance be not look good
2582,congressional republican evidently hop that by repeat an untruth they ll convince american voter and perhaps themselves that it s a truth on wednesday say the affordable care act have fail the undistilled version of this view come from house speaker paul ryan r wi who emerge wednesday from a meet with vice president elect mike penny to assert this law have fail american be struggle the law be fail while we speak thing be only get worse under obamacare the healthcare system have be ruin dismantle under obamacare every one of those statement be demonstrably untrue how do we know this we know because every measure of healthcare spend access and cost have improve since the passage and implementation of the affordable care act timothy mcbride of washington university in st louis have do the heavy lift of pull together the relevant chart and graph and post them online in a series of tweet compile on storify we ve cull some of the most important and present them here we should add first that ryan also pledge once the gop repeal the law to make sure that there be a stable transition to a truly patient center system we want every american to have access to quality affordable health coverage this be nothing but fatuous gobbledygook the gop have have six year to come up with an alternative plan and never have do so it current strategy be to repeal the affordable care act now and then cook up a replacement sometime in the next two three even four year they can t even agree on a time frame what exactly be a patient center system anyway here be the chart courtesy of professor mcbride first the overall uninsured rate have come sharply down since the advent of obamacare the uninsured rate for non elderly adult fell from nearly in to le than accord to the center for disease control and prevention it's now at a historic low the decline in uninsured rat be especially pronounce among lower income american accord to the council of economic advisor and other source uninsured rat fell by more than percentage point among the poorest american eligible for medicaid under the affordable care act those earn le than of the federal poverty line although republican claim that even if the affordable care act bring down the uninsured rate it enrollee have trouble see a doctor that isn t true numerous study debunk claim that doctor shun affordable care act enrollee this sample by the council of economic advisor show that the decline in the uninsured rate be closely associate with a reduction in people who be prevent from seek and find medical care because of it cost hospital be major beneficiary of the affordable care act a the department of health and human service and the council of economic advisor report hospital uncompensated care cost fell sharply in medicaid expansion state a patient treat a indigent in the past be now cover by medicaid their uncompensated care cost fell from an average of operate cost before the affordable care act to le than afterward a decline worth ten of billion of dollar nationwide overall national health spend have come down even faster than be predict a a share of gross domestic product the average growth in per enrollee spend by private health plan in key category have slow materially since the passage of the affordable care act in from annual growth average in to in spend growth on hospital service physician service and prescription drug all slow medicare which have institute numerous cost control initiative under the affordable care act have see an overall decline in spend per enrollee finally even though employer base insurance hasn t yet be directly affect by the affordable care act there seem to be a spillover effect from the overall reduction in healthcare spend growth premium rise by an average a year in the year prior to passage of the affordable care act but only since accord to kaiser family foundation s annual survey of employer health benefit republican have promise to give american a health insurance system better than the affordable care act s and at lower cost this be almost surely a chimera no plan that the gop have consider would expand coverage beyond the affordable care act to the extent that the plan would reduce cost they would do so by relieve the federal government of responsibility for pay for coverage and place it even more heavily on the shoulder of individual and family that s not lower cost it s just shift them to those least able to pay the fact that the gop will have to face be that bring healthcare to more american cost money take it away from million of american will cost money too no one claim either before the passage of the affordable care act or afterward that it be perfect or that it would solve america s healthcare crisis in one swipe what become evident in the three year since the individual insurance exchange open for business on jan be that the subsidy for premium need to be increase and improve because they re inadequate especially a household cross the threshold of of the federal poverty line at which subsidy be eliminate at about for a family of four middle class family in the individual insurance market feel overburden they blame obamacare for this injustice the real culprit be republican who have refuse to consider any approach to the affordable care act except repeal now the gop be it on healthcare and it s discover that craft a solution from scratch may be almost impossible what become evident during the most recent open enrollment period for obamacare exchange be that obamacare be more popular than ever a kevin drum of mother jones observe enrollment grow to million up by about million from even in the face of higher premium in any case more than of all enrollee be entitle to subsidy which limit and in some case cancel out the higher price yet the gop pledge to overturn all that the question the party never have find an answer to be if this be what a failure look like how would it define a success
2583,do obamacare work it s worth reflect upon after president trump and house republican fail on friday to repeal and replace the disaster of obamacare ever since the affordable care act be pas in it have be so contentious that it can be difficult to see beyond the partisan debate but by look at the many way the law have change health care it s possible to hazard some judgment the answer may vary with your own experience but it ultimately depend on what you value for those who believe the primary goal of the law should have be to bring health insurance to more american the rational answer should be yes obamacare succeed more than million american gain health coverage through the law continue read the main story for those who believe the primary goal of the law should have be to make health insurance affordable to all who want it the rational answer be no obamacare do not achieve uniform affordability health care in the unite state remain the most expensive in the world and coverage remain out of the financial reach of many american for those who believe the primary goal of the law be to make american healthier the answer have to be it be too soon to tell one thing be clear though the affordable care act have shift the nation s baseline expectation for how health care should work it success have push republican politician like mr trump into make expansive promise to provide insurance to all american it failure have become focal point too lead to call for lower insurance deductible and for more choice in doctor and hospital since republican take power public opinion have suddenly tip in it favor for lot of people obamacare have become synonymous with the health care system itself with it many miracle and dysfunction there be layer beneath each judgment of course the law be broad and complex with many goal and provision this assessment touch on it largest achievement and it biggest disappointment for many important question there be not yet strong evidence either way success twenty million more people have health insurance provide health coverage to the uninsured be obamacare s principal goal and on that measure it have succeed the gain of million insure base on an obama administration estimate last year be probably now even higher not everyone share the goal of expand health coverage and some of those newly insure bristle under an individual mandate to have insurance or pay a fine still many of the newly insure could not have afford insurance before the law pas or would have be shut out because of pre exist health condition the rapid reduction in the number of uninsured american have shift the political debate about health reform in many republican be comfortable with a status quo in which many american couldn t get health care now mr trump and republican leader in congress have say their plan could cover a many people a the affordable care act although a recent c b o analysis disagree it have make many american more financially secure health insurance be suppose to provide access to health care but it be also a financial product intend to protect people from catastrophic bill if they be sick or injure it be still early to measure the health law s full impact but several study have find that low income american have become le vulnerable to health relate financial shock study have find that fewer people struggle with medical bill or avoid medical care because of cost and that medical debt and bill in collection have decline it have reduce inequality in an era of grow income and wealth inequality obamacare be a starkly redistributive law not only do it subsidize health insurance for those with low and middle income but it also raise tax on high earner this mix of policy make the law controversial but it also further the obama administration s goal of narrow the gap between rich and poor american it make health insurance more comprehensive before obamacare many product could be call health insurance now health plan be require to cover service like maternity care and treatment for drug addiction and they can t cap how much they will pay in a give year many of the law s critic dislike it numerous coverage mandate but the new rule have increase patient access to service like mental health counsel contraception and cancer screen it lower the federal deficit obamacare be devise with a mix of new spend and tax along with cut to the federal medicare program so that it would save more than it cost a recent forecast from the congressional budget office estimate that if leave in place the affordable care act will continue to save federal dollar through at least recent legislation have make some small change to the law s tax provision but analyst at the committee for a responsible federal budget run the number again and find very little difference failure health insurance remain very expensive obamacare s marketplace and medicaid expansion make health coverage a good deal for those near the poverty line but those earn not much more still often struggle to pay health plan premium and face deductible that be much higher than those see in a typical employer health plan in the law s first three year premium be lower than expect and grow slowly but price shoot up this year cause financial shock for buyer who don t receive government help in pay their premium several analyst believe the increase result from recent policy change and too low early price and may represent a one time market correction insurer have also say that they have find the pool of obamacare enrollee to be sicker and le predictable in their health care need than expect some people who earn enough to qualify for meager or no subsidy find health care unaffordable the health care system remain complex and confuse president barack obama have describe the health law s market a be like a kayak or an amazon for health insurance they re not health insurance be easier to shop for now but it remain a complicate and opaque product and select the right health plan be often frustrate or impossible for american unsure of their health need or unable to decode jargon like out of pocket maximum or in network provider after pick their insurance patient can still struggle to use it and can get stick with surprise bill or long negotiation with their insurance company photo ever since it passage obamacare have draw both praise and protest like this one by anti abortion demonstrator outside the supreme court in june credit brendan hoffman for the new york time in many part of the country only one insurer even offer health plan limit the choice available to consumer if you like your plan you can t always keep your plan the obamacare marketplace be set up to encourage customer to frequently switch their health plan to avoid steep price increase the market have also be turbulent with insurer go out of business exit market or shift around their offer each year that have lead to a large fraction of renew customer who change health plan every year unable to pick a plan they like and stick with it or your doctor many obamacare health plan try to keep price competitive have sharply limit the number of doctor or hospital they will cover obamacare s author do not expect so call narrow network plan to become so widespread these have make it hard for some customer to find any plan that include their favor provider and mean that switch plan often mean switch doctor too the narrower network despite their inconvenience have help keep insurance price lower too soon to tell we don t know if the law make america healthier health insurance be not the same thing a health and we still have very limit data about whether the law s coverage expansion have lengthen live or improve their quality in meaningful way there be some encourage but very early evidence that low income people in two state that expand medicaid report improve overall health compare with their low income neighbor in a state that do not and there be research that more low income american have visit a doctor and have receive some basic preventive health service include prescription contraceptive and treatment for diabetes but it will probably take many more year before it be clear whether the law have be beneficial to public health or how large that effect may be even though the law allow million more people to get coverage that s a small fraction of the nation s population and it often take year for health care service to result in measurable benefit it s unclear what the law have do to national health spend a crucial goal for mr obama be bend the cost curve and slow the accelerate cost of health care in the unite state growth in health spend have indeed slow in the year since obamacare s passage but it be hard to untangle the effect of the health law from other force affect health spend include the great recession rise insurance deductible and a slowdown in the development of new medical technology the health law s most ardent champion include mr obama credit it for this change but many economist be uncertain whether the slowdown be a result of the law or a mere coincidence it may have improve the quality of care in hospital the health law contain many provision intend to make medical care safer and more evidence base the health system be still often a dangerous place for patient but fewer be contract infection in the hospital for example or leave the hospital only to be readmitted in a few week some trend be underway before the health law pas so it be difficult to tease out how much change be cause by obamacare or would have happen anyway
2584,million may lose coverage next year if congress do not repeal obamacare that s not what this week s congressional budget office cbo analysis say but it be reality cbo s estimate model seem impervious to reality in the real world the obamacare exchange be in crisis million of uninsured people willingly pay or avoid irs penalty and consumer struggle with rise premium and cost share requirement but for cbo obamacare be a sea of tranquility the agency assume that only million people under the age of will be uninsured this year and next if obamacare be leave in place to hit that mark million fewer people would have to be uninsured this year than last that seem unlikely the national health interview survey nhis estimate that million people under age lack coverage a of september last year the most recent date for which government survey data be available that represent little improvement over it estimate of million a of december mean that the number of non elderly uninsured decline by only half a million through the first nine month of last year since then the obamacare individual exchange have begin to implode fewer people sign up during the open enrollment period this year than last due in part to premium hike that average percent other insurance company didn t bother raise price they flee the exchange by january county be down to their last insurer five entire state have just a single company sell through the exchange a rational observer might worry that the exchange be on the brink of doom not cbo it analyst believe that obamacare be on the cusp of a miracle the number of nonelderly uninsured not only will drop this year but hold steady in accord to cbo even though million could find themselves without an insurer in their exchange that improbably happy outcome would change the agency say if congress be to enact it repeal bill in that case cbo warn the number of uninsured will abruptly increase by million that include million medicaid beneficiary cbo believe they will drop out of a program for which they pay virtually nothing and that fully pay virtually all their medical expense ditto for million people in the exchange and an additional million with job base coverage cbo believe that these million people so detest be insure that they will drop out of the system immediately after congress repeal the tax on the uninsured that number will rise to million next year accord to cbo that include million who will abandon medicaid million who will drop their employer sponsor coverage and million who will leave the exchange these million people will not despite what you ve read lose coverage for the most part cbo say they will choose not to have insurance because they choose to be cover by insurance under current law only to avoid pay penalty emphasis add the gop bill not only retain exist subsidy and medicaid expansion through it provide additional money to state to stabilize their fail obamacare exchange but that spend accord to cbo win t halt the stampede to the obamacare exit induce by repeal of the individual mandate cbo s illusion about the effectiveness of the mandate don t square with reality the evidence suggest that the mandate have do little to reduce the number of uninsured the irs report that in million pay the penalty million obtain an exemption while million simply ignore it that s million people who have choose to be uninsured despite the government s threat of tax penalty cbo s estimate of the effect of the gop bill be deeply flaw let s do the math nhis estimate that million non elderly be uninsured in the year before obamacare be fully implement if cbo be to be believe the number of uninsured will increase by million next year join another million uninsured people who either pay the tax in the past or find a way to avoid it that would mean that percent of the uninsured million out of million apparently would want nothing to do with obamacare s government define and subsidize benefit be congress to repeal the individual mandate if cbo be correct the government will have spend billion between and on subsidy and medicaid expansion only to end up reduce the number of nonelderly uninsured from million to million it be also possible that cbo be wrong about the individual mandate that seem intuitively obvious to people whose head aren t bury in cbo s faulty model some future progressive government may well decide to attack the problem of homelessness by supplement the mortgage interest deduction with a tax on the homeless but do anyone believe that if a republican congress repeal that tax homeowner would shred their mortgage and head to the grate cbo s estimate of the effect of the gop bill be deeply flaw they begin with rosy assumption about the current law in the face of considerable contrary evidence they assume that insurer will continue to sell in the exchange next year and that there will be no appreciable disruption in coverage they appear to believe that higher coverage rat that have occur since be more attributable to tax penalty than to subsidy despite feckless irs enforcement and they assume that even if congress keep the tax credit and medicaid expansion in place next year and spend additional money to stabilize insurance market million more people will join the rank of the uninsured congress should set policy base on reality not on cbo s speculation obamacare exchange be fall apart medicaid spend be grow at an excessive pace and tax the uninsured be both ineffective and politically unsustainable the house and senate should act now to stabilize those market repeal the law include the individual mandate and replace it with a system that put doctor and patient in control of health care decision make
2585,come november the grim trudge across the increasingly barren obamacare landscape begin anew illinois consumer likely face stagger price hike for individual insurance policy some type of plan could cost an average of percent to percent more ditto across the country a first tranche of state approve rat with similarly cardiac arrest induce premium increase many illinois consumer will find fewer choice because major carrier flee this market unitedhealthcare bolt so do aetna land of lincoln health collapse mid year leave policy holder to scramble for coverage that could cost them plenty in many place across illinois and the nation people will find drastically fewer choice of plan than they do last year state struggle with obamacare be undermine the law the affordable care act have be criticize since it be pas in it success depend on state support their marketplace and enrol healthy consumer sept those insurer flee because they didn't want to lose more money on a government run market that be so far out of whack a market they think likely will never be profitable for them that isn't surprise a we enumerate below but by diagnose obamacare all of u can see the mistake that any repair or replacement can avoid so let's look at the fail and how they can drive solution obamacare fail because it flunk economics and human nature it straitjacketed insurer into provide overly expensive soup to nut policy it wasn't flexible enough so that people could buy a much coverage a they want and could afford not what the government dictate many healthy people primarily want catastrophic coverage obamacare couldn't lure them in couldn't persuade them to buy on the chance they'd get sick obamacare fail because the penalty for go uncover be too low when stack against it skyrocket premium cost next year the penalty for stay uninsured be per adult or perhaps percent of a family's taxable household income that's far le than many american would pay for coverage obamacare fail because insurance be base on risk pool that be the lucky subsidize the unlucky the unlucky who have big health problem and big medical bill reap much greater benefit than those who remain healthy and out of the doctors' office but obamacare's rule hamstring insurer they can't exclude people for pre exist condition and can't charge older customer more than three time a much a the young those be good goal but they skew the market in way obamacare didn't figure out how to offset result young and healthy consumer pay far more in premium than their claim probably would justify in order to subsidize the unexpectedly large influx of older sicker customer who require expensive care too many unlucky people too few lucky people that will collapse any insurance scheme obamacare fail because it allow american to sign up after they get sick and need help pay all those medical bill insurance should be structure so that although you don't know if you'll need it you pay for it anyway just in case your alternative be financial doom but if you can game the system and for example buy auto coverage after you crash into your garage then you have no incentive to buy insurance beforehand obamacare fail because it hasn't tame u s medical cost health care be about supply and demand people who get coverage use it especially if the law mandate free preventive care iron law of economics nothing be free someone pay to pretend otherwise be folly those force combine to spike the cost of care and thus insurance cost obamacare fail because too many carrier simply can't cover expense let alone turn a profit in this rigidly control system take blue cross and blue shield of illinois the state's dominant obamacare insurer last year for every dollar the carrier collect it spend buy care and provide service for customer accord to bcbs president maurice smith no wonder bcbs be propose rate increase from percent to percent for it individual plan a question loom be obamacare plunge in a so call insurance death spiral be the market so unstable that plan be doom to get more and more expensive drive more american and more insurer out of the market until obamacare thud to the pavement more american have health insurance for now we won't predict that but neither do we see a mathematical alternative what's clear be that the solution to obamacare be implicit in it failure a repair or replace system have to be more flexible let insurer offer a wider range of plan so that consumer not lawmaker or bureaucrat dictate what's best for them that system should protect those who carry continuous coverage not coddle those who duck in and out of plan when their health need change a new system also should scrap the job kill obamacare mandate that discourage company from hire and discourage worker from add hour instead of gear subsidy to income let american not cover via an employer reap tax credit to help finance their insurance purchase on the open market and tell u again why can't insurer sell policy across state line imagine the price competition that would unleash we can deny the current system's fail or we can parlay our evolve knowledge into something much better put another way the next president and congress either reckon with obamacare's failure or wait for the thud
2586,remember how much republican want to repeal obamacare the republican majority in the house of representative have vote more than time to repeal the law conservative have twice bring challenge to the supreme court a court with powerful voice that often lean in their direction only to be largely rebuff both time the last government shutdown be drive by republican who insist on defunding obamacare not to be confuse with what may be the next government shutdown drive by republican insist on defunding plan parenthood some suggest that the call for repeal obamacare be fade sarah kliff argue that the near complete absence of obama s health overhaul in last week s republican presidential debate be remarkable maybe but don t count on it in gop presidential candidate jeb bush s white paper on how he would get to percent growth through supply side tax cut his team of economist stress that repeal the affordable care act will be an important mean of enhance economic growth front runner donald trump say just last week that he be go to replace obamacare with donaldcare which would be both absolutely great and really spectacular repeal health care reform remain a prominent talk point for wisconsin gov scott walker and sen ted cruz both gop presidential candidate well since we don t know what s in it i can t comment on donaldcare but i can tell you this about obamacare when it come to meet one of it most important goal provide coverage to the uninsured it be work extremely well it s post historical gain on this front and in so do both insulate itself from repeal and create a daunt political challenge for it opponent the fact of the case be thoroughly draw out in this new analysis by my colleague matt broaddus and edwin park b p from the center on budget and policy priority a the figure above show newly release census data show that the share of those without health coverage fell from percent to last year that s the largest single year drop on record base on data go back to hi source b p see text in this type of work the strength of your find be much bolster when you see them across multiple source a b p point out the census find be consistent with the historic coverage gain measure in the center for disease control cdc and prevention s national health interview survey and several private survey at percent the cdc s estimate uninsured rate for the first quarter of be the lowest since the cdc begin collect these data in and more than percent below the peak in the aca take a two pronged attack on cover the uninsured subsidize private coverage through the exchange and expand medicaid in the state a well a d c that accept that part of the deal both private and public coverage be make significant gain speak of anti obamacare ideology and it effect on people b p provide this reveal calculation if the uninsured rate have fall in non expansion state at the same rate a in expansion state an additional million uninsured american would have gain coverage last year coverage last year grow most quickly among household with income below their uninsured rate fell from about percent to about percent in one year household above have lower uninsured rat to start with so we would expect smaller change but they too go from percent to percent such truth be more than inconvenient for swear enemy of the law they can bob and weave in their primary but once they reach the general election their democratic opponent will slam them on these point and unless they re will to massively flip pretty unimaginable give the heat generate by the issue for conservative people represent in the number and chart above will rightfully fear that their health security be at stake i cannot overemphasize the importance of these fact and yes i know better than most that our political discourse too often exist in a fact free zone but the success of the aca strike at the heart of the dysfunction strategy employ extremely effectively by anti government conservative this be the self fulfil prophecy strategy that campaign on washington be break send me there and i ll make sure it stay that way remember when government mess up when it shut down when it fail to address the thing that matter to most people economic opportunity wage stagnation affordable college and instead squabble about plan parenthood the winner be those who can say see we tell you government s break never mind that those make that case be the one do the break but with obamacare they ve be fail and the more we elevate that case the closer we get to the road back to factville
